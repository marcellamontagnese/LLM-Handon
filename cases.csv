"History A 26-year-old teacher has consulted her general practitioner (GP) for her persistent cough. She wants to have a second course of antibiotics because an initial course of amoxicillin made no difference. The cough has troubled her for 3 months, since she moved to a new school. The cough is now disturbing her sleep and making her tired during the day. She teaches games, and the cough is troublesome when going out to the playground and when jogging. In her medical history she had her appendix removed 3 years ago. She had her tonsils removed as a child and was said to have recurrent episodes of bronchitis between the ages of 3 and 6 years. She has never smoked and takes no medication other than an oral contraceptive. Her parents are alive, and well and she has two brothers, one of whom has hay fever.","Examination The respiratory rate is 18/min. Her chest is clear, and there are no abnormalities in the nose or pharynx or the cardiovascular, respiratory or nervous systems. Investigations ‚Ä¢ Chest X-ray is reported as normal. ‚Ä¢ Spirometry is carried out at the surgery, and she is asked to record her peak flow rate at home, the best of three readings every morning and every evening for 2¬†weeks. Spirometry results are as follows: Actual Predicted FEV1 (L) 3.9 3.6‚Äì4.2 FVC (L) 5.0 4.5‚Äì5.4 FER (FEV1/FVC) (%) 78 75‚Äì80 PEF (L/min) 470 440‚Äì540 FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; FER, forced expiratory ratio; PEF, peak expiratory flow. A peak flow recording is shown in Figure¬†4.1.","Questions ‚Ä¢ What is your interpretation of these findings? ‚Ä¢ What do you think is the likely diagnosis, and what would be appropriate treatment? 1 360 380 400 420 440 460 480 500 Peak Flow (L/min) 10 Days Figure 4.1‚ÄÇ Peak flow recording at home over 11 days.  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 14","ANSWER 4 The peak flow pattern shows a degree of diurnal variation. This does not reach the diagnos- tic criteria for asthma, but it is suspicious. The mean daily variation in peak flow from the recordings is 36‚ÄâL/min, and the mean evening peak flow is 453‚ÄâL/min, giving a mean diur- nal variation of 8 per cent. There is a small diurnal variation in normals, and a variation of >15 per cent is diagnostic of asthma. In this patient the label of ‚Äòbronchitis‚Äô as a child was probably asthma. The family history of an atopic condition (hay fever in a brother) and the triggering of the cough by exercise and going out in the cold also suggest bronchial hyper- responsiveness typical of asthma. Patients with a chronic persistent cough of unexplained cause should have a chest X-ray. When the X-ray is clear the cough is likely to be produced by one of three main causes in non-smokers. Around half of such cases have asthma or will go on to develop asthma over the next few years. Half of the rest have rhinitis or sinusitis with a postnasal drip. In around 20 per cent the cough is related to gastro-oesophageal reflux. A small number of cases will be caused by otherwise-unsuspected problems such as foreign bodies, bronchial ‚Äòadenoma‚Äô, sarcoidosis or fibrosing alveolitis. Cough is a common side effect in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In this patient the diagnosis of asthma was confirmed with an exercise test, which was associ- ated with a 25 per cent drop in FEV after completion of 6 min of vigorous exercise. Alternative bronchoprovocation tests include the use of inhaled methacholine or histamine, and a fall in FEV1 greater than 20 per cent. After the exercise test, an inhaled steroid was given, and the cough settled after 1 week. The inhaled steroid was discontinued after 4 weeks and replaced by a Œ≤2-agonist to use before exercise. However, the cough recurred with more evident wheeze and shortness of breath, and treatment was changed back to an inhaled steroid with a Œ≤2-agonist as needed. If control was not established, the next step would be to check inhaler technique and treatment adher- ence and to consider adding a long-acting Œ≤2-agonist. In some cases, the persistent dry cough associated with asthma may require more vigorous treatment than this. Inhaled steroids for a month or more or even a 2-week course of oral steroids may be needed to relieve the cough. The successful management of dry cough relies on establishing the correct diagnosis and treating it vigorously. Key Points ‚Ä¢ The three commonest causes of persistent dry cough with a normal chest X-ray are asthma (50 per cent), sinusitis and postnasal drip (25 per cent) and reflux oesopha- gitis (20 per cent). ‚Ä¢ Asthma may present as a cough (cough-variant asthma) with little or no airflow obstruction initially, although this develops later. ‚Ä¢ Persistent cough with normal chest examination is unlikely to have a bacterial cause or respond to antibiotic treatment.  15"
"History A 56-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. Twenty-four hours previously she developed a continuous pain in the upper abdomen that has become progressively more severe. The pain radiates into the back. She feels nauseated and alternately hot and cold. Her past medical history is notable for a duodenal ulcer, which was successfully treated with Helicobacter eradication therapy 5 years earlier. She smokes 15¬†cigarettes a day and shares a bottle of wine each evening with her husband. History A 66-year-old woman, a retired nurse, consults her general practitioner (GP) with a 4-month history of tiredness, slight breathlessness on exertion and loss of weight from 71 to 65‚Äâkg. Her appetite is unchanged and normal; she has no nausea or vomiting, but over the last 2 months she has had an altered bowel habit with constipation alternating with her usual and normal pattern. She has not seen any blood in her faeces and has had no abdominal pain. She has had no post-menopausal bleeding. There is no relevant past or family history, and she is on no medication. She has smoked 20 cigarettes daily for 48 years and drinks 20‚Äì28 units of alcohol a week. History A man of 45 consults his general practitioner (GP) with a 6-month history of reduced appe- tite and weight loss, from 78 to 71‚Äâkg. During the last 3 months he has had intermittent nausea, especially in the mornings, and in the last 3 months the morning nausea has been accompanied by vomiting on several occasions. For 1 month he has noted swelling of his ankles. Despite his weight loss he has recently noticed his trousers getting tighter. He has had no abdominal pain. He has no relevant past history and knows no family history as he was adopted. He takes no medication. From the age of 18 he has smoked 5‚Äì6 cigarettes daily and drunk 15‚Äì20 units of alcohol per week. He has been a chef all his working life, without excep- tion in fashionable restaurants. He now lives alone as his wife left him 1 year ago.","Examination The patient looks unwell and dehydrated. She weighs 115‚Äâkg. She is febrile, 38.5¬∞C; her pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 124/76‚ÄâmmHg. Cardiovascular and respiratory system exami- nation is normal.

Figure 5.1‚ÄÇ Plain abdominal X-ray.  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 16 Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the likeliest diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate the patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 18,"ANSWER 5 This woman has acute cholecystitis. Cholecystitis is most common in obese, middle-aged women and classically is triggered by eating a fatty meal. Cholecystitis is usually caused by a gallstone impacting in the cystic duct. Continued secretion by the gallbladder leads to increased pressure and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Bacterial infection is usu- ally by Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Ischaemia in the distended gallbladder can lead to perforation, causing either generalized peritonitis or formation of a localized abscess. Alternatively the stone can spontaneously disimpact and the symptoms spontane- ously improve. Gallstones can become stuck in the common bile duct, leading to cholangitis or pancreatitis. Rarely, gallstones can perforate through the inflamed gallbladder wall into the small intestine and cause intestinal obstruction (gallstone ileus). The typical symptom of acute cholecystitis is sudden-onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain that radiates into the back. An episode of prolonged right upper quadrant pain associ- ated with fever, suggests acute cholecystits rather than simple biliary colic. Jaundice usually occurs if there is a stone in the common bile duct. There is usually fever, tachycardia, guarding and rebound tenderness in the right upper quadrant (Murphy‚Äôs sign). In this patient the leucocytosis and raised CRP are consistent with acute cholecystitis. If the serum bilirubin and liver enzymes are very deranged, acute cholangitis due to a stone in the common bile duct should be suspected. The abdominal X-ray is normal; the majority of gallstones are radiolucent and do not show on plain films. ! Differential diagnosis The major differential diagnoses of acute cholecystitis include biliary colic, ¬≠perforated peptic ulcer, acute pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, subphrenic abscess, retrocaecal ¬≠appendicitis, right pyelonephritis and perforated carcinoma or diverticulum of the hepatic flexure of the colon. Myocardial infarction or right lower lobe pneumonia may also mimic cholecystitis. This patient should be admitted under the surgical team. Serum amylase should be measured to rule out pancreatitis. Blood cultures should be taken. Chest X-ray should be performed to exclude pneumonia and erect abdominal X-ray to rule out air under the diaphragm, which occurs with a perforated peptic ulcer. An abdominal ultrasound will show gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. The patient should be kept nil by mouth, given intra- venous fluids, analgesia and commenced on intravenous cephalosporins and metronidazole. The patient should be examined regularly for signs of generalized peritonitis or cholangitis. If the symptoms settle down the patient is normally discharged to be readmitted in a few weeks once the inflammation has settled down to have a cholecystectomy. There is a trend to performing immediate cholecystectomy in low risk patients. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Acute cholecystitis typically causes right upper quadrant pain and a positive Murphy‚Äôs sign. ‚Ä¢ Potential complications include septicaemia and peritonitis.  Case 6:‚ÄÇ Weight Loss 17 Case 6:‚ÄÇ Weight Loss ANSWER 6 The investigations show a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia. In a premenopausal woman the most likely cause would be excessive menstrual blood loss. In men or postmenopausal women the most likely cause would be loss from the gastrointestinal tract. This woman has an altered bowel habit, which suggests a problem with the lower gastrointestinal tract and a diagnosis of carcinoma of the colon, which would also explain her weight loss. A barium enema revealed a neoplasm in the sigmoid colon, confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no pulmonary metastases and no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or hepatic metastases, respectively. She proceeded to a sigmoid colectomy and end-to-end anastomosis and was regularly fol- lowed-up for any evidence of recurrence. Histology showed a grade I tumour. Carcinoma of the colon is increasing in frequency. If it presents at an early stage, then the prospect for cure is good. Rectal bleeding, alteration in bowel habit for longer than 1 month at any age, or iron-deficient anaemia in men or postmenopausal women are indications for investigation of the gastrointestinal tract. In younger people there may be a hereditary ele- ment to carcinoma of the colon. Smoking is a risk factor for carcinoma of the colon. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Carcinoma of the colon can present with few or no symptoms or signs in the ¬≠gastrointestinal tract. ‚Ä¢ Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia warrants investigation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.  19 Liver Case 7:‚ÄÇ Nausea and Weight Loss"
"history ‚Ä¢ Alcoholic liver disease has a poor prognosis if the alcohol intake is not terminated.  Case 8:‚ÄÇ Anorexia and Fever 21 Case 8:‚ÄÇ Anorexia and Fever History A 22-year-old man presented with malaise and anorexia for 1 week. He vomited on one occa- sion, with no blood. He has felt feverish but has not taken his temperature. For 2 weeks he has had aching pains in the knees, elbows and wrists without any obvious swelling of the joints. He has not noticed any change in his urine or bowels. Five years ago he had glandular fever confirmed serologically. He smokes 25 cigarettes per day and drinks 20‚Äì40 units of alcohol per week. He has taken marijuana and ecstasy occa- sionally over the past 2 years and various tablets and mixtures at clubs without being sure of the constituents. He denies any intravenous drug use. He has had irregular homosexual contacts but says that he has always used protection. He claims to have had an HIV test that was negative 6 months earlier. He has not travelled abroad in the last 2 years. He is unemployed and lives in a flat with three other people. There is no relevant family history.",Examination He has a temperature of 38.6¬∞C and looks unwell. He looks as if he may be a little jaundiced. He is a little tender in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. There are no abnormalities to find on examination of the joints or in any other system. Investigations Normal Haemoglobin 14.1‚Äâg/dL 13.3‚Äì17.7‚Äâg/dL Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 85‚ÄâfL 80‚Äì99‚ÄâfL White cell count 11.5 √ó 109/L 3.9‚Äì10.6 √ó 109/L Platelets 286 √ó 109/L 150‚Äì440 √ó 109/L Prothrombin time 17‚Äâs 10‚Äì14‚Äâs Sodium 135‚Äâmmol/L 135‚Äì145‚Äâmmol/L Potassium 3.5‚Äâmmol/L 3.5‚Äì5.0‚Äâmmol/L Urea 3.2‚Äâmmol/L 2.5‚Äì6.7‚Äâmmol/L Creatinine 64‚ÄâŒºmol/L 70‚Äì120‚ÄâŒºmol/L Bilirubin 50‚Äâmmol/L 3‚Äì17‚Äâmmol/L Alkaline phosphatase 376‚ÄâIU/L 30‚Äì300‚ÄâIU/L Alanine aminotransferase 570‚ÄâIU/L 5‚Äì35‚ÄâIU/L Fasting glucose 4.1‚Äâmmol/L 4.0‚Äì6.0‚Äâmmol/L,Questions ‚Ä¢ What is your interpretation of the findings? ‚Ä¢ What is the likely diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What treatment is required?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 22,"ANSWER 8 The diagnosis is likely to be acute viral hepatitis. The biochemical results show abnormal liver function tests with a predominant change in the transaminases, indicating a hepatocellular rather than an obstructive problem in the liver. This might be caused by hepatitis A, B or C. The raised white count is compatible with acute hepatitis. Homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse are risk factors for hepatitis B and C. Other viral infections, such as cytomegalo- virus and herpes simplex virus, are possible. As the drug ingestion history is unclear, there is a possibility of a drug-induced hepatitis. The prodromal joint symptoms suggest a viral infection as the cause, and this is more common with hepatitis B. Serological tests can be used to see whether there are immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies indicating acute infec- tion with one of these viruses, to confirm the diagnosis. Viral loads can also be measured. The reported negative HIV test 6 months earlier makes an HIV-associated condition unlikely although patients are not always reliable in their accounts of HIV tests, and HIV seroconver- sion should also be considered. This man has acute hepatitis B infection. About 30% of cases develop jaundice. Treatment is basically supportive in the acute phase. Antiviral drugs are not indicated in the vast major- ity of patients with acute hepatitis B. The prothrombin time in this patient is raised slightly but not enough to be an anxiety or an indicator of very severe disease. Liver function will need to be measured to monitor enzyme levels as a guide to progress. Alcohol and any other hepatotoxic drug intake should be avoided until liver function tests are back to normal. Rare complications of the acute illness are fulminant hepatic failure, aplastic anaemia, myocardi- tis and vasculitis. The opportunity should be taken to advise him about the potential dangers of his intake of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol, and of sexually transmitted diseases and to offer him appropriate support in these areas. HBV can survive outside the body for some time and he should advise his flatmates not to share razors and toothbrushes with him. They should consider being vaccinated. Only about 5% of adults with acute hepatitis B will develop chronic infection. Patients with alcoholic liver disease who are infected with hepatitis B have a worse liver prognosis. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Viral hepatitis is often associated with a prodrome of arthralgia and flu-like symptoms. ‚Ä¢ Confirmatory evidence should be sought for patients‚Äô reports of HIV test results. ‚Ä¢ Sexual transmission and intravenous drug use are the main methods of transmission of hepatitis B in adults in the developed world. ‚Ä¢ Acute hepatitis B infection is a notifiable disease in the UK.  23"
History A 27-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department complaining of pain across her back. She became unwell 2 days previously when she started to develop a fever and an ache in her back. The pain has become progressively more severe. She has vomited twice in the past 6‚Äâh. She has had no previous significant medical history apart from an uncompli- cated episode of cystitis 3 months ago.,"Examination She looks unwell and is flushed. Her temperature is 39.5¬∞C. Her pulse is 120‚Äâbeats/min, and blood pressure is 104/68‚ÄâmmHg. Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is unremarkable. Her abdomen is generally tender, but most markedly in both loins. Bowel sounds are normal. Investigations Normal Haemoglobin 15.3‚Äâg/dL 11.7‚Äì15.7‚Äâg/dL White cell count 25.2 √ó 109/L 3.5‚Äì11.0 √ó 109/L Platelets 406 √ó 109/L 150‚Äì440 √ó 109/L Sodium 134‚Äâmmol/L 135‚Äì145‚Äâmmol/L Potassium 4.1‚Äâmmol/L 3.5‚Äì5.0‚Äâmmol/L Urea 14.2‚Äâmmol/L 2.5‚Äì6.7‚Äâmmol/L Creatinine 106‚ÄâŒºmol/L 70‚Äì120‚ÄâŒºmol/L Albumin 44‚Äâg/L 35‚Äì50‚Äâg/L C-reactive protein (CRP) 316‚Äâmg/L <5‚Äâmg/L Urinalysis: ++ protein; +++ blood; ++ nitrites Urine microscopy: >50 red cells; >50 white cells Abdominal X-ray: normal",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the likely diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 26,"ANSWER 10 This woman has the symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis is much more common in women than men and occurs due to ascent of bacteria up the urinary tract. Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression and structurally abnormal urinary tracts increase the likelihood of ascending infection. ! Differential diagnosis Pyelonephritis causes loin pain, which can be unilateral or bilateral. The differential diag- noses of loin pain include obstructive uropathy, renal infarction, renal cell ¬≠carcinoma, renal papillary necrosis, renal calculi, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, medullary sponge kidney and loin-pain haematuria syndrome. Fever may be as high as 40¬∞C with associated systemic symptoms of anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Some patients may have preceding symptoms of cystitis (dysuria, urinary fre- quency, urgency and haematuria), but these lower urinary tract symptoms do not always occur in patients with acute pyelonephritis. Many patients will give a history of cystitis within the previous 6 months. Elderly patients with pyelonephritis may present with non- specific symptoms and confusion. Pyelonephritis may also mimic other conditions, such as acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis and lower lobe pneumonia. There is usually marked tenderness over the kidneys both posteriorly and anteriorly. Severe untreated infection may lead to septic shock. The raised white cell count and CRP are consistent with an acute bacterial infection. Microscopic haematuria, proteinuria and leucocytes in the urine occur because of inflamma- tion in the urinary tract. The presence of bacteria in the urine is confirmed by the reduction of nitrates to nitrites. This woman should be admitted. Blood and urine cultures should be taken, and she should be commenced on intravenous fluids and antibiotics until the organism is identified, and then an oral antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive can be used. Initial therapy could be with gentamicin and ampicillin or ciprofloxacin. She should have a renal ultrasound scan to exclude any evidence of obstruction. In patients with obstructive uropathy, infection may lead to a pyonephrosis with severe loin pain, fever, septic shock and renal failure. If there is evidence of a hydronephrosis in the context of urinary sepsis, a nephrostomy should be inserted urgently to prevent these complications. Patients with an uncomplicated renal infection should be treated with a 2-week course of antibiotics and then have a repeat urine culture 10‚Äì14 days after treatment has finished to confirm eradication of infection. In patients with infection complicated by stones or renal scarring, a 6-week course of treatment should be given. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Acute pyelonephritis may present with or without preceding lower urinary tract symptoms. ‚Ä¢ Renal ultrasound should be performed within 24‚Äâh of admission to exclude urinary tract obstruction. ‚Ä¢ Antibiotics should be continued for at least 2 weeks in cases of acute pyelonephritis to minimize the risk of relapse.  27"
History A 64-year-old man goes to his general practitioner (GP) because he has become increasingly overweight. He has gained 8‚Äâkg in weight over the past 6 months. He has noticed that he is constantly hungry. He has found that he is bruising easily. He finds it difficult to get up from his armchair or to climb stairs. He feels depressed and finds himself waking early in the mornings. He has had no previous physical or psychiatric illnesses. He is a retired miner and lives with his wife in a terraced house. He smokes 30 cigarettes per day and drinks 15 units of alcohol per week. History A 62-year-old woman is encouraged to consult her general practitioner because her husband thinks she has become rather confused and irritable over the last 3‚Äì4 weeks. She admits to feeling rather irritable and has found it difficult to remember lists on occasions. There is no relevant medical history. On systems review she complains of some non-specific back pain. This has been present for 2 months and is maximal in the low thoracic area. She does not recall any trauma at the start of the problem and the pain is gradually increasing in severity. It is partially relieved by paracetamol and ibuprofen that she buys in the local pharmacy. She has noticed some abdominal discomfort and constipation which she has related to the medication for the back pain. She takes no other medicines and does not drink or smoke.,"Examination He is overweight, particularly in the abdominal region. There are purple stretch marks on his abdomen and thighs. His skin is thin, and there are spontaneous bruises. His pulse is 76/min, regular, and blood pressure is 168/104‚ÄâmmHg. There is peripheral oedema. Otherwise, exami- nation of his heart, respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. His neurological examina- tion is otherwise normal, apart from some weakness in shoulder abduction and hip flexion.

Fat accumulation causes a ‚Äúmoon face‚Äù, a ‚Äúbuffalo hump‚Äù and enlarged fat pads in the supraclavicular fossae. The hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia would fit this diagnosis. In addition psychiatric disturbances, typically depression, may occur in Cushing‚Äôs syndrome. Cushing‚Äôs disease is due to a pituitary adenoma secreting adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The term Cushing‚Äôs syndrome is a wider one and encompasses a group of disorders caused by overproduction of cortisol. ! Causes of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome ‚Ä¢	 ACTH secretion by a basophil adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland (Cushing‚Äôs disease). ‚Ä¢	 Ectopic ACTH secretion (e.g. from a bronchial carcinoma), often causing a massive release of cortisol and a severe and rapid onset of symptoms. ‚Ä¢	 Primary adenoma/carcinoma of the adrenal cortex (suppressed ACTH). ‚Ä¢	 Iatrogenic: corticosteroid treatment. This is the commonest cause in day-to-day clini- cal practice. This patient‚Äôs primary presenting complaint is rapid-onset obesity. The principal causes of obesity are ‚Ä¢ genetic; ‚Ä¢ environmental: excessive food intake, lack of exercise; ‚Ä¢ hormonal: hypothyroidism, Cushing‚Äôs syndrome, polycystic ovaries and hyperprolactinaemia; and ‚Ä¢ alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing‚Äôs syndrome. This patient should be investigated by an endocrinologist. The first point is to establish that this man has abnormal cortisol secretion. There should be loss of the normal diurnal rhythm with an elevated midnight cortisol level or increased urinary conjugated cortisol excretion. A dexamethasone suppression test would normally suppress cortisol excretion. It is then impor- tant to exclude common causes of abnormal cortisol excretion, such as stress/depression or alcohol abuse. Measurement of ACTH levels distinguishes between adrenal (low ACTH) and pituitary/ectopic (high ACTH) causes. This patient drinks alcohol moderately and has a nor- mal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. His depression seems to be a consequence of his corti- sol excess rather than a cause as he has no psychiatric history. His ACTH level is elevated. Bronchial carcinoma is a possibility as he is a heavy smoker, and the onset of his Cushing‚Äôs syndrome has been rapid. However his chest X-ray is normal. In this man a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1-weighted coronal image) through the pituitary shows a hypointense microadenoma (Figure¬†11.1, arrow). This can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Transsphenoidal microadenomectomy is the treatment of choice as it cures the patient and leaves them with normal hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal function.  Case 11:‚ÄÇ Weight Gain 29 Key Points ‚Ä¢ Patients with rapid-onset obesity should have endocrine causes excluded. ‚Ä¢ Corticosteroid treatment is the commonest cause for Cushing‚Äôs syndrome. ‚Ä¢ Patients with severe and rapid-onset Cushing‚Äôs syndrome often have ectopic ACTH secretion or cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours. Figure 11.1‚ÄÇ Magnetic resonance imaging scan through the pituitary.   Case 12:‚ÄÇ Personality Change 31 Case 12:‚ÄÇ Personality Change ANSWER 12 There are a number of clues here that there is a significant problem. She presents with a com- bination of character change, back pain, abdominal pain and constipation. Abdominal pain and constipation might be related to opiate analgesic therapy but not to paracetamol and ibuprofen. The abnormal findings of low values for haemoglobin, white cells and platelets and mildly abnormal renal function are found in the investigations. The haematological investigations suggest that there is a bone marrow problem which is likely to be related to the bony tenderness in the thoracic spine. The character change and the abdominal symptoms, with the finding of a possible bony problem, raise the possibility of hypercalcaemia which would explain all these findings. The clinical manifestations of hypercalcaemia include confusion, reduced concentration, fatigue, muscle weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, dehy- dration, nephrolithiasis, hypertension, short QT on ECG, bone changes (osteitis fibrosa cys- tica, brown tumours). 90% of cases of hypercalcaemia are related to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, with multiple myeloma as a common malignancy. Other causes are ! ‚Ä¢ sarcoidosis ‚Ä¢ ectopic hormone production in squamous cell lung cancer ‚Ä¢ tertiary hyperparathyroidism (in renal failure) ‚Ä¢ thyrotoxicosis ‚Ä¢ vitamin D intoxication ‚Ä¢ thiazide diuretics (mild hypercalcaemia) ‚Ä¢ adrenal insufficiency ‚Ä¢ tuberculosis The investigations indicating bone marrow depression here and the bone pain suggest that malignancy is the likely cause. The high ESR could be compatible with any disseminated malignancy but is characteristic of multiple myeloma. The important first investigations here are to confirm the hypercalcaemia and to investigate the back pain. When interpreting serum calcium the serum albumin should be measured and the calcium level corrected for abnormalities in albumin. Also the serum phosphate may help, being usually low in hyperparathyroidism and high in malignancy. In the presence of hypercalcaemia the parathyroid hormone level will be below normal unless there is hyperparathyroidism. In this case the serum calcium and phosphate were both raised and the X-rays of the thoracic spine and skull (see Figure 12.1) showed lytic bone lesions typical of multiple myeloma. Plain X-rays are preferred to a radio-isotope bone scan which may not show hot spots from radio- isotope accumulation in osteoblasts typical of other malignant bone involvement.  Case 12:‚ÄÇ Personality Change 33 The diagnosis was confirmed with protein electrophoresis which showed a monoclonal band in the gamma region and by bone marrow biopsy showing an accumulation of abnormal plasma cells. Myeloma occurs in around 1‚Äì4/100,000 adults per year and is treated by steroids and chemotherapy and by stem cell transplants. Remissions are common but cure is unusual."
"History A 67-year-old man is referred to a neurologist by his general practitioner (GP). His symptoms are of weakness and wasting of the muscles of his left hand. He has noticed the weakness is worse after using his hand, for example, after using a screwdriver. He has also noticed cramps in his forearm muscles. On a few occasions recently he has felt choking sensations after tak- ing fluids. Past medical history is notable for hypertension for 15 years and a myocardial infarction 3 years previously. Medication consists of simvastatin, aspirin and atenolol. He is a retired university lecturer. He lives with his wife, and they have two grown-up children. He is a non-smoker and drinks a bottle of wine a week.","Examination Blood pressure is 146/88‚ÄâmmHg. There are no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respira- tory systems or the abdomen. There is some wasting of the muscles in the upper limbs, partic- ularly in the left hand. There is some fasciculation in the muscles of the forearms bilaterally. Power is globally reduced in the left hand and slightly reduced in the right hand. Muscle tone is normal. The biceps and triceps jerks are brisk bilaterally. There is no sensory loss. There is slight dysarthria.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What is the prognosis?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 36,"ANSWER 13 This man has evidence of lower motor neurone problems in the hands with weakness, wast- ing and fasciculation. The most likely diagnosis is motor neurone disease. This is a degenera- tive disease of unknown cause that affects the motor neurones of the spinal cord, the cranial nerve nuclei, and the motor cortex. The disease usually presents between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Weakness and wasting of the muscles of one hand or arm is the commonest presentation. Weakness is most marked after exertion. Painful cramps of the forearm muscles are common in the early phases of the disease. Patients may present with lower limb weakness or with dys- arthria or dysphagia. The characteristic physical sign of this condition is fasciculation, which is an irregular rapid contraction of segments of muscle, caused by denervation of the muscle from a lower motor neurone lesion. As in this man, reflexes can be brisk due to loss of cortical motor neurones. There is no sensory loss. Motor neurone disease is divided into five types: ‚Ä¢ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonest, upper and lower motor neurone) ‚Ä¢ primary lateral sclerosis (upper motor neurone) ‚Ä¢ progressive muscular atrophy (lower motor neurone) ‚Ä¢ progressive bulbar palsy (bulbar lower motor neurone) ‚Ä¢ pseudobulbar palsy (bulbar upper motor neurone) In advanced cases diagnosis is easy, but early cases are more problematic. Limb weak- ness worsening with fatigue may be confused with myasthenia gravis. Dysphagia and dysarthria in the elderly are much more commonly due to the pseudobulbar palsy of cerebrovascular disease. Cervical myelopathy is another common cause of wasting and fasciculation of the upper limbs without sensory loss. Brachial plexus lesions from trauma or invasion by an apical lung tumour (Pancoast tumour) may affect one arm. A predomi- nant motor peripheral neuropathy causes a symmetrical pattern of weakness, and reflexes are reduced. Unfortunately motor neurone disease is a progressive and incurable condition. Patients tend to develop a spastic weakness of the legs. Bulbar palsy causes dysarthria and dysphasia. Sphincter function is usually not affected. Intellect is generally not affected. There is no curative treatment for this condition. The mean duration of survival from presen- tation is between 2 and 4 years. The patient and his family will have to be told of the diagnosis and prognosis. Support must be given by a multidisciplinary team. As the disease progresses and speech deteriorates communication may be helped by computer-linked devices. A feed- ing gastrostomy may be required to enable adequate calorie intake. Non-invasive ventilation can be used to help respiratory failure, but death usually occurs from bronchopneumonia."
"History A 43-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) complaining of diplopia, more marked in the evenings, for the last 3 months. She has noticed difficulty holding her head up, again especially in the evenings. She has problems finishing a meal because of dif- ficulty chewing. Her husband and friends have noticed that her voice has become quieter. She has lost about 3‚Äâkg in weight in the past 6 months. The woman has had no significant previous medical illnesses. She lives with her husband and three children. She is a non-smoker and drinks about 15 units of alcohol per week. She is taking no regular medication.","Examination She looks well, and examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. Power in all muscle groups is grossly normal but seems to decrease after testing a movement repetitively. Tone, coordination, reflexes and sensation are normal. Bilateral ptosis is present and is exacerbated by prolonged upward gaze. Pupillary reflexes, eye movements and fundoscopy are normal.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What are the major differential diagnoses? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 38,"ANSWER 14 This woman‚Äôs generalized weakness is caused by myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is due to the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies causing impaired neuromuscular trans- mission. It characteristically affects the external ocular, bulbar, neck and shoulder girdle muscles. Weakness is worse after repetitive movements, which cause acetylcholine depletion from the presynaptic terminals. The onset is usually gradual. Ptosis of the upper lids is often associated with diplopia due to weakness of the external ocular muscles. Speech may become soft when the patient is tired. Symptoms are usually worse in the evenings and better in the mornings. Permanent paralysis eventually develops in some muscle groups. In severe cases respiratory weakness occurs. ! Differential diagnoses of generalized muscle weakness ‚Ä¢	 Motor neurone disease: suggested clinically by muscle fasciculation and later by marked muscle weakness. ‚Ä¢	 Muscular dystrophies: selective muscular weakness occurs in specific diseases (e.g. facioscapulohumeral dystrophy). There is usually a family history. ‚Ä¢	 Dystrophia myotonica: this causes ptosis, wasting of the masseter, temporal and sternomastoid muscles and distal muscular atrophy. There is a characteristic facial appearance with frontal baldness, expressionless facies and sunken cheeks. There may be gonadal atrophy and mental retardation. There is usually a family history. The electromyogram (EMG) is diagnostic. ‚Ä¢	 Polymyositis: this may have an acute or chronic onset. A skin rash and joint pains are common. The creatine kinase level is raised, and a muscle biopsy is diagnostic. ‚Ä¢	 Miscellaneous myopathies: thyrotoxic, hypothyroid, Cushing‚Äôs, alcoholic. ‚Ä¢	 Non-metastatic associations of malignancy: thymoma is associated with myasthenia gravis in 10 per cent of cases; the Eaton‚ÄìLambert myasthenic syndrome is associ- ated with small-cell lung carcinoma. This patient should be investigated by a neurologist. The EMG will demonstrate fatiguability in response to repetitive supramaximal stimulation. Intravenous injection of edrophonium (Tensilon) will increase muscular power for a few minutes. Blood should be assayed for acetyl- choline receptor antibodies (present in 90 per cent). Computed tomography (CT) of the tho- rax should be performed to detect the presence of a thymoma or lung cancer. Corticosteroids are the drugs of first choice. Anticholinesterase drugs greatly improve muscle power but have many side effects. Thymectomy should be considered. It is most effective within 5 years of diagnosis and when there is no thymoma. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Myasthenia gravis is a cause of abnormal muscular fatiguability. ‚Ä¢ In its initial stages it affects certain characteristic muscle groups.  39"
"History An 80-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) with pain and swelling in her left knee. The pain began 2 days previously, and she says that the knee is now hot, swollen and painful on movement. In the past she has a history of mild osteoarthritis of the hips. She has occasional heartburn and indigestion. She had a health check 6 months previously and was told that everything was fine except for some elevation of her blood pressure, which was 172/102 mmHg, and her creatinine level, which was around the upper limit of normal. The blood pres- sure was checked several times over the next 4 weeks and found to be persistently elevated, and she was started on treatment with 2.5‚Äâmg bendroflumethiazide. The last blood pressure reading was 148/84‚ÄâmmHg. There is no relevant family history. She has never smoked, and her alcohol consumption averages four units per week. She takes occasional paracetamol for hip pain.","Examination Her blood pressure is 142/86‚ÄâmmHg. The temperature is 37.5¬∞C, and the pulse is 88/min. There is grade 2 hypertensive retinopathy. There is no other abnormality on cardiovascular or respira- tory examination. In the hands there are Heberden‚Äôs nodes over the distal interphalangeal joints. The left knee is hot and swollen with evidence of effusion in the joint with a positive patellar tap. There is pain on flexion beyond 90 degrees. The right knee appears normal.

Figure 16.1‚ÄÇ X-ray of both knees.  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 42,"ANSWER 15 This patient has a monoarthropathy, a rash and red eyes. Investigations show a raised white cell count and ESR. The diagnosis in this man was postinfective inflammatory mucositis and arthritis, often shortened to reactive arthritis, and also known as Reiter‚Äôs syndrome. This dis- ease classically presents with a triad of symptoms (although all three may not always be present): ‚Ä¢ seronegative arthritis affecting mainly lower limb joints ‚Ä¢ conjunctivitis ‚Ä¢ non-specific urethritis (NSU). The trigger can be non-gonococcal urethritis (Chlamydia trachomatis)) or certain enteric infections (Salmonella, Shigella, Yerinia and Campylobacter. This patient is likely to have contracted NSU after sexual intercourse in Thailand. On direct questioning he admitted to the presence of a urethral discharge. The acute arthritis is typically a monoarthritis but can develop into a chronic relapsing destructive arthritis affecting the knees and feet and causing sacroiliitis and spondylitis. Tendinitis and plantar fasciitis may occur. The red eyes are due to conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and can recur with flares of the arthritis. The rash on the patient‚Äôs palmar surfaces is the characteristic brown macular rash of this condition: kerato- dermablenorrhagica. Other features of this condition that are sometimes seen include nail dystrophy and a circinate balanitis. Systemic manifestations such as pericarditis, pleuritis, fever and lymphadenopathy may occur in this disease. The ESR is usually elevated. ! Differential diagnoses of an acute monoarthritis ‚Ä¢	 Gonococcal arthritis: occasionally a polyarthritis affecting the small joints of the hands and wrists, with a pustular rash. ‚Ä¢	 Acute septic arthritis: the patient looks ill and septic, and the skin over the joint is very erythematous. ‚Ä¢	 Other seronegative arthritides: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthropathy. ‚Ä¢	 Viral arthritis: usually polyarticular. ‚Ä¢	 Acute rheumatoid arthritis: usually polyarticular. ‚Ä¢	 Acute gout: most commonly affects the metatarsophalangeal joints. ‚Ä¢	 Pseudogout: caused by sodium pyrophosphate crystals; often affects large joints in older patients. ‚Ä¢	 Lyme disease: caused by Borrelia burgdorfii infection transmitted by a tick bite; may have the characteristic skin rash: erythema chronicum migrans. ‚Ä¢	 Haemorrhagic arthritis: usually a history of trauma or bleeding disorder. This patient should have urethral swabs taken to exclude chlamydial/gonococcal infections and the appropriate antibiotics given. His knee should be aspirated. A Gram stain will exclude a pyogenic infection, and birefringent microscopy can be used to detect uric acid or pyrophos- phate crystals. This patient should be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the pain, and he may require intraarticular steroids or oral prednisolone. Sulfasalazine is used in refractory cases.. If his disease relapses he should be referred to a rheumatologist. He and his wife should be referred to the sexually transmitted disease clinic for counselling and testing for other sexually transmitted diseases, such as hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis. Key Points ‚Ä¢ The most likely causes of an acute large joint monoarthritis are a septic arthritis and a seronegative arthritis. ‚Ä¢ Septic arthritis must be recognized and treated as a medical emergency as it can cause rapid destruction of the joint and septicaemia.  Case 16:‚ÄÇ Pain in the Knee 41 Case 16:‚ÄÇ Pain in the Knee ANSWER 16 The clinical picture is one of an acute monoarthritis. The patient has a history of some hip pains, but this and the Heberden‚Äôs nodes are common findings in an 80-year-old woman, related to osteoarthritis. The blood results show a raised white cell count and ESR, a raised blood sugar, and renal function at the upper limit of normal. ! Differential diagnoses of pain in the knee The differential diagnosis includes trauma, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout. The recent introduction of a thiazide diuretic for treatment of the hypertension increases the suspicion of gout. Pseudogout is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crys- tals and would be expected to show calcification in the articular cartilage in the knee joint. The X-rays here show some joint space narrowing but no evidence of calcification in the articular cartilage. The fever, high white cell count and ESR are compatible with acute gout. The raised glucose may also be a side effect of thiazide diuretics. If this remains after the acute arthritis has subsided, then it may need further treatment. Precipitation of gout by thiazides is more likely in older women, particularly in the presence of renal impairment and diabetes. It may involve the hands, be polyarticular, and can affect exist- ing Heberden‚Äôs nodes. The serum uric acid level is likely to be raised, but this occurs commonly without evidence of acute gout. The definitive investigation is aspiration of the joint. The fluid should be sent for culture and inspection with a specific request for inspection for crystals. A high white cell count would be expected in an acute inflammatory arthritis. The diagnosis is made from the needle-like crystals of uric acid, which are negatively birefringent under polarized light, unlike the positively birefringent crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. In this case the pain in the joint was partly relieved by the aspiration. Treatment with a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug should be covered by a proton pump inhibitor in view of her history of heartburn and indigestion. The thiazide diuretic was changed to an angioten- sin-converting enzyme inhibitor as treatment for her hypertension, and the blood glucose elevation resolved. A short course of prednisolone can also be used in acute gout. A xanthine oxidase inhibitor such as allopurinol might be considered if the serum urate remained raised or the condition did not settle after stopping the thiazide diuretic. Key Points ‚Ä¢ A careful drug history is an essential part of the history. ‚Ä¢ Thiazide diuretics can precipitate diabetes and gout, especially in the elderly.  43"
"history. ‚Ä¢ The differential diagnosis of pancytopenia with peripheral blasts includes AML, myelodysplasia, a blast crisis from a chronic myeloid leukaemia, a mixed pheno- type acute leukaemia, folate or B12 deficiency and miliary tuberculosis.   Case 18:‚ÄÇ Tiredness, Breathlessness and Headaches 47 Case 18:‚ÄÇ Tiredness, Breathlessness and Headaches History A 63-year-old woman goes to her general practitioner (GP) complaining of extreme tiredness. She has been increasingly fatigued over the past year, but in recent weeks she has become breathless on exertion and light-headed and complained of headaches. Her feet have become numb, and she has started to become unsteady on her feet. She has had no significant previ- ous medical illnesses. She is a retired teacher and lives alone. Until the last 2 years she was active, walking 3 or 4 miles a day. She is a non-smoker and drinks about 15 units of alcohol per week. She is taking no regular medication. Her mother and one of her two sisters have thyroid problems.","Examination Her conjunctivae are pale, and sclerae are yellow. Her temperature is 37.8¬∞C. Her pulse rate is 96/min and regular, and blood pressure is 142/72‚ÄâmmHg. Examination of her cardiovas- cular, respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. She has a symmetrical distal weakness affecting her arms and legs. Knee and ankle jerks are absent, and she has extensor plan- tar responses. She has sensory loss in a glove-and-stocking distribution with a particularly severe loss of joint position sense.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the differential diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you further investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 44,"ANSWER 17 The combination of anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia is termed pancytopenia. Causes of severe pancytopenia include aplastic anaemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, hae- matological malignancy such as myelodysplasia or leukaemia and tuberculosis. This woman has spontaneous bruising due to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). She has profound thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 9 √ó 109/L. An increased tendency to bleed or bruise can be due to platelet, coagulation or blood vessel abnormalities. Platelet/ vessel wall defects cause spontaneous purpura in the skin and mucous membranes or immediately after trauma. A lack of a history of trauma and frequent severe bruising raises the possibility of a bleeding diathesis. Disorders of platelet function usually cause immediate bleeding after a procedure whereas coagulation defects cause haematomas and haemarthroses usually with a time delay after trauma. The age of onset of bleeding may distinguish between a congenital and an acquired cause of bleeding. The onset of bleeding in later life suggests an acquired condition. Family history may identify a con- dition such as haemophilia. The distribution of bruising may also suggest the diagnosis. Thrombocytopenic purpura is most evident over the ankles and pressure areas. Retinal haemorrhages tend to occur if there is a combination of severe thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Senile purpura and steroid-induced bruising occur mainly on the forearms and backs of the hands. Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura typically occurs over the extensor aspects of the limbs and buttocks. Scurvy causes bleeding from the gums and around the hair follicles. Non-accidental injury in children can present with bruising. It is important to take a dietary and drug history. Drugs which can cause bruising include anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs and steroids. Petechiae are small capillary haemorrhages that characteristically develop in crops in areas of increased venous pressure, such as the dependent parts of the body. Petechiae are the smallest bleeding lesions (pinhead in size), and suggest problems with platelet number or function. Purpura are larger in size than petechiae with variable shape and involve bleeding into subcutaneous tissues. Purpura can be seen in a variety of bleeding disorders, including thrombocytopenia and coagulation cascade disorders. Palpable purpura can be seen in vas- culitic processes such as Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura. AML is the most common acute leukaemia in adults with a mean age at presentation of 65 years. Patients with AML generally present with symptoms related to complications of pan- cytopenia (eg, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), including weakness, breath- lessness and easy fatigability, infections of variable severity, and/or haemorrhagic findings such as gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. Most patients will have blasts on the peripheral blood smear and the diagnosis is confirmed by the results of a bone marrow examination. Blast forms must account for at least 20% of the total cellularity of the bone marrow sample. This patient should be immediately referred to a haematology unit. Platelet transfusion is usually given if there is significant bleeding or the platelet count is less than 15 √ó 109/L to prevent a major spontaneous bleed. Initial investigations are examination of the peripheral blood smear and performing a bone marrow aspirate.  Case 17:‚ÄÇ Easy Bruising 45 Key Points ‚Ä¢ A careful history and examination can help in the diagnosis of easy bruising. The patient should be asked about associated trauma, location and severity of bruising, bleeding history with previous procedures, nutrition, medication use, and family"
"History A 55-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP), complaining of lack of energy. He has become increasingly tired over the past 18 months. He works as a solicitor and describes episodes when he has fallen asleep in his office. He is unable to stay awake after 9:30 pm and sleeps through until 7:30 am. He finds it difficult to concentrate at work and has stopped playing his weekly game of tennis. He had an episode of depression 10 years ago related to the break-up of his first marriage. He has no current personal problems. He has had no other major illnesses. His brother developed type 1 diabetes mellitus at the age of 13. On direct questioning, he has noticed that he has become more constipated but denies any abdominal pain or rectal bleeding. He has put on 8‚Äâkg in weight over the past year.","Examination On examination he is overweight. His facial skin is dry and scaly. His pulse is 56/min, regular, and blood pressure is 146/88‚ÄâmmHg. Examination of his cardiovascular, respiratory and abdom- inal systems is unremarkable. Neurological examination showed a little proximal weakness.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the most likely diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 54,"ANSWER 20 Fever in a patient who has had a transplant is most often related to a common pathogen, but the presence of immunosuppression raises the possibility of an opportunistic infection. The possibil- ity is higher here because of the increased immunosuppression related to the episodes of rejection. The symptoms of dry cough and shortness of breath point to a respiratory focus of the infec- tion. Although there was nothing to find on examination of the respiratory system other than the increased respiratory rate and the original chest X-ray was normal, the decrease in oxygen saturation confirms a significant problem with gas exchange in the lung. The combination of a fever and dry cough with no respiratory signs and increasing hypoxia suggests a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The chest X-ray may appear normal in the early stages before an increase in diffuse shadowing, with an alveolar filling pattern most marked in the mid and lower zones, often sparing the costophrenic angles (Figure¬†20.1). This patient was taking co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis against pneumocystis but this was stopped because of a rash increasing the risk of infection. The first investigation here should be a chest X-ray. Even if sputum is being produced, Pneumocystis jiroveci cannot usually be found in the sputum and needs a technique such as sputum induction with hypertonic saline or bronchoscopy with alveolar lavage to sample alveolar contents. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a fungus previously called Pneumocystis carinii. It occurs commonly in the environment but does not cause infection in the absence of immunosuppression. Samples from induced sputum or alveolar lavage are stained with a silver stain, periodic acid Schiff or by immunofluorescence. Treatment is usually with high dose co-trimoxazole but the previous rash in this patient means that alternative treatments such as dapsone and trimethoprim or clindamycin and primaquine rather than the more toxic alternative of intravenous pentamidine are required. Prednisolone is often used initially in treatment in cases with significant hypoxia. Key Points ‚Ä¢	Pneumocystis jiroveci is a widespread organism but only causes disease in immuno- suppressed patients. ‚Ä¢ Dry cough, fever and breathlessness are common symptoms with tachypnoea and significant hypoxia. ‚Ä¢ Diagnosis usually requires sampling of alveolar contents by lavage or sputum induction.

"history of 6 years of similar problems, it would be reasonable to accept the diagnosis and reassure the patient. However, the family history of carcinoma of the colon raises the pos- sibility of a condition such as familial polyposis coli. The family history, the circumstances of the grandmother‚Äôs death and the patient‚Äôs feelings about this should be explored fur- ther. Anxiety about the family history might contribute to the patient‚Äôs own symptoms or her presentation at this time. If there are living family members with polyposis coli, DNA probing may be used to identify family members at high risk. If any doubt remains in this woman it would be sensible to proceed to a barium enema or a colonoscopy to rule out any significant problems. The diagnosis of IBS relies on the exclusion of other significant conditions, such as inflamma- tory bowel disease, diverticular disease or large-bowel malignancy. In patients under the age of 40 years it is usually reasonable to do this based on the history, examination and a normal full blood count and ESR. In older patients, sigmoidoscopy and barium enema or colonoscopy should be performed. A plan of investigation and management should be clearly established. The symptoms tend to be persistent and are not helped by repeated normal investigations looking for an underlying cause. Symptoms may be helped by antispasmodic drugs or tri- cyclic antidepressants. Some patients will benefit from the consumption of a high-fibre diet.",,,"ANSWER 32 The pattern of the pain, the absence of physical signs, normal investigations and reproduc- tion of the pain during sigmoidoscopy all make it likely that this is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This is a very common condition accounting for a large number of referrals to gas- troenterology clinics. IBS is often episodic, with variable periods of relapse and remission. Periods of frequent defaecation alternate with periods of relative constipation. Relapses are often associated with periods of stress. In IBS it is common to have a history of other conditions, such as migraine and menstrual irregularity. Under the age of 40 years with a"
"history of abdominal pain of colonic type and tendency to constipation. The recent problems with increased pain, tenderness, fever, raised white cell count and CRP and a mass in the left iliac fossa would be compatible with an acute exacerbation of her diverticular disease. In her case there is no evidence of peritonitis, which would signal a possible perforation of one of the diverticula. The differential diagnosis, with the suggestion of a mass and change in bowel habit, would be carcinoma of the colon or Crohn‚Äôs disease. In the absence of evidence of perforation with leak of bowel contents into the peritoneum (no peritonitis) or obstruction (normal bowel sounds, no general distension), treatment should be based on the presumptive diagnosis of diverticulitis. A colonoscopy should be performed at a later date to exclude the possibility of a colonic neoplasm. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen will delineate the mass and suggest whether there is evidence of local abscess or fistula formation. Treatment should include broad-spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metroridazole), intravenous fluids and rest. Further investigations are indicated, including urea and electrolytes, creatinine, glucose val- ues; liver function tests; and blood cultures. A colonoscopy should be performed at a later date to exclude the possibility of a colonic neoplasm. Repeated severe episodes, bleeding or obstruction may necessitate surgery. Patients are advised to eat a high fibre diet once the acute episode has subsided.",,,"ANSWER 36 This woman has diverticulitis. Colonic diverticula are small outpouchings that are most commonly found in the left colon. They are very common in the elderly Western population, probably due to a deficiency in dietary fibre. Symptomatic diverticular disease has many of the features of irritable bowel syndrome. Inflammation in a diverticulum is termed divertic- ulitis. In severe cases, perforation, paracolic abscess formation or septicaemia may develop. Other potential complications include bowel obstruction, formation of a fistula into the rec- tum or vagina, and haemorrhage. The barium enema from 4 years ago shows evidence of diverticular disease with outpouch- ings of the mucosa in the sigmoid colon. This would be consistent with the long-standing"

The most likely explanation is that this patient has taken a phenytoin overdose, tablets that her father uses to control his epilepsy. She may have taken an overdose because of con- cern about her imminent exams. Excessive ingestion of barbiturates, alcohol and phenytoin all cause acute neurotoxicity manifested by vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia and nystagmus. In severe cases coma, respiratory depression and hypotension occur. Vertigo is an awareness of disordered orientation of the body in space and takes the form of a sensation of rotation of the body or its surroundings. ! Causes of vertigo Peripheral lesions Central lesions Benign positional vertigo Brainstem ischaemia Vestibular neuronitis Posterior fossa tumours M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease Multiple sclerosis Middle-ear diseases Alcohol/drugs Aminoglycoside toxicity Migraine, epilepsy The duration of attacks is helpful in distinguishing some of these causes of vertigo. Benign positional vertigo lasts less than 1 min. Attacks of M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease are recurrent and last up to 24 h. Vestibular neuronitis does not recur but lasts several days, whereas vertigo due to ototoxic drugs is usually permanent. Brainstem ischaemic attacks occur in patients with evidence of diffuse vascular disease, and long tract signs may be present. Multiple sclerosis may initially present with an acute attack of vertigo that lasts for 2‚Äì3 weeks. Posterior fossa tumours usually have symptoms and signs of space-occupying lesions. Acoustic neuromas often present with vertigo and deafness. Migrainous attacks are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Temporal lobe epilepsy may also produce rotational vertigo, often associated with auditory and visual hallucinations. Central lesions produce nystagmus, which is multi- directional and may be vertical. Peripheral lesions induce a unilateral horizontal nystagmus. The diagnosis in this case can be made by measuring plasma phenytoin levels and by asking the patient‚Äôs father to check if his tablets are missing. Gastric lavage should be carried out if it is within 12‚Äâh of ingestion of the tablets. Oral activated charcoal may be useful. National poison information services are available to advise on treatment. Before discharge she should be assessed and have counselling and treatment by psychiatrists specializing in adolescents."
"History A 44-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) complaining of head- aches. These headaches have been present in previous years but have now become more intense. She describes the headaches as severe and present on both sides of her head. They tend to worsen during the course of the day. There is no associated visual distur- bance or vomiting. She also complains of loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping, with early morning waking. She has had eczema and irritable bowel syndrome diagnosed in the past, but these are not giving her problems at the moment. She is divorced with two children, aged 10 and 12 years, whom she looks after. She has a part-time job as an office cleaner. Her mother has recently died of a brain tumour. She smokes about 20 cigarettes per day and drinks 15 units of alcohol per week. She takes regular paracetamol or ibu- profen for her headaches. History A 55-year-old man is admitted to hospital with headache and confusion. He has a cough and a temperature of 38.2¬∞C. He does not complain of any other symptoms. Two months earlier he had been admitted with a productive cough, and acid-fast bacilli had been found in the sputum on direct smear. He had lost weight and complained of occasional night sweats. He had a history of a head injury 10 years previously. He smoked 15 ciga- rettes a day and drank 40‚Äì60 units of alcohol each week. He was found a place in a local hostel for the homeless and sent out after 1 week in hospital on antituberculous treat- ment with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide together with pyridox- ine. His chest X-ray at the time was reported as showing probable infiltration in the right upper lobe.","Examination She looks withdrawn. Her pulse is 74/min and regular; blood pressure is 118/76‚ÄâmmHg. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, breasts and reticuloendothelial system is normal. There are no abnormal neurological signs, and fundus- copy is normal. Examination He looked thin and unwell, and he was slightly drowsy. His mini-mental test score was 8/10. There were some crackles in the upper zones of the chest posteriorly. His respiratory rate was 22/min. There were no neurological signs.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What are the major differential diagnoses? ‚Ä¢ How would you manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 128,"ANSWER 48 This patient has a chronic tension headache. This is the commonest form of headache. It occurs mainly in patients under the age of 50 years. The headache is usually bilateral, often with diffuse radiation over the vertex of the skull, although it may be more localized. The pain is often characterized as a sense of pressure on the head. Visual symptoms and vomiting do not occur. The pain is often at its worst in the evening. Patients may show symptoms of depression (this woman has biological symptoms of loss of appetite and disturbed sleep pattern). Sufferers may reveal sources of stress such as bereavement or difficulty with work. There may be an element of suggestion as in this case, with concern that she may have inherited a brain tumour from her mother. She is looking after two children alone and working part-time. A normal neurological examination is important for reassurance. ! Major differential diagnoses of chronic headaches ‚Ä¢	Classic migraine: characterized by visual symptoms followed within 30 min by the onset of severe hemicranial throbbing, headache, photophobia, nausea and vomit- ing lasting for several hours. The onset is usually in early adult life, and a positive family history may be present. ‚Ä¢	Cluster headaches: mainly affect men. The pain is unilateral, usually orbital and severe in nature. It characteristically occurs 1‚Äì2 h after sleeping, lasts 1‚Äì2 h, and recurs nightly for 6‚Äì8 weeks. ‚Ä¢	Headache caused by a space-occupying lesion (such as tumour or abscess): Often the headache is initially mild, but over a few weeks becomes severe and is exacer- bated by coughing or sneezing. The headache is usually worse in the morning and is associated with vomiting. There will often be other signs, including personality change and focal neurological signs. ‚Ä¢	Miscellaneous causes: sinusitis, dental disorders, cervical spondylosis, glaucoma, post-traumatic headache. It is important to come to a clear diagnosis and to address the patient‚Äôs beliefs and concerns about the symptoms. In some circumstances it may be necessary to perform a computed tomography (CT) head scan for reassurance. The question of depression needs to be explored further and may need treating with antidepressants. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Tension headaches occur mainly in those aged under 50, and patients often show features of depression. ‚Ä¢ Tension headache should be diagnosed after other causes have been excluded.  Case 49:‚ÄÇ Headache and Confusion 129 Case 49:‚ÄÇ Headache and Confusion"
History A 29-year-old woman complained of a sudden onset of right-sided chest pain with shortness of breath. It woke her from sleep at 3:00 am. The pain was made worse by a deep breath and by coughing. The breathlessness persisted over the 4‚Äâh from its onset to her arrival in the emergency department. She has a slight non-productive cough. There is no relevant previous medical history except asthma controlled by salbutamol and beclometasone. There is no fam- ily history of note. She works as a driving instructor and had returned from a 3-week holiday in Australia 3 weeks previously. She had no illnesses while she was away. She has taken an oral contraceptive for the last 4 years.,"Examination She has a temperature of 37.4¬∞C, her respiratory rate is 24/min, the jugular venous pres- sure is raised 3‚Äâcm, the blood pressure is 110/64‚ÄâmmHg, and the pulse rate is 128/min. Peak flow rate is 410‚ÄâL/min. In the respiratory system, expansion is reduced because of pain. Percussion and tactile vocal fremitus are normal and equal. A pleural rub can be heard over the right lower zone posteriorly. There are no other added sounds. Otherwise the examina- tion is normal.",,"ANSWER 49 The chest X-ray shows extensive changes in the right upper zone that seem as if they are likely to be more extensive than those described at the first admission 2 months earlier. It is likely that this is a worsening of his pulmonary tuberculosis. This might have occurred because he had a resistant organism or, more likely, because he had not taken his treatment as prescribed. Risk factors for development of tuberculosis are poor nutrition, high alcohol intake and immunosuppression (HIV, immunosuppressive therapy). Higher rates occur in those from the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa. The headache and confusion raise the possibility of tuberculous meningitis. Other possibili- ties would be liver damage from the antituberculous drugs and the alcohol, although clinical jaundice would be expected, or hyponatraemia or hypercalcaemia. If these are not present a lumbar puncture would be indicated if there is no sign to suggest raised intracranial pressure. It would be advisable to do a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain first since a fall related to his high alcohol consumption might have led to a subdural haemorrhage to give him his headache and confusion. It is now 2 months since the initial finding of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, and the cultures and sensitivities of the organism should be available. These should be checked to be sure that the organism was Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and that it was sensitive to the four antituber- culous drugs he was given. As a check on compliance, blood levels of antituberculous drugs can be measured. The urine will be coloured orangey-red by metabolites of rifampicin taken in the previous 8‚Äâh or so. Comparison with his old chest X-rays showed extension of the right upper-lobe shadowing. It is difficult to be sure about activity from a chest X-ray, but extension of shadowing is obvi- ously suspicious. ‚ÄòSofter‚Äô, fluffier shadowing is more likely to be associated with active disease. A direct smear of the sputum showed that acid-fast bacilli were still present on direct smear. He confirmed that he was not taking his medication regularly. His headache and confusion resolved as he stopped his high alcohol intake. Subsequently the antituberculous therapy should be given as directly observed therapy (DOT) in a thrice-weekly regime supervised at each administration by a district nurse or health visitor. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Poor adherence to treatment regimes is the commonest cause of failure of antitu- berculous and other treatment. ‚Ä¢ Directly observed therapy should be used when there is any doubt about likely adherence to treatment. ‚Ä¢ Initial polymerase chain reaction testing on sputum can predict the likelihood of resistant organisms.

"history of chronic lung disease, equivocal results are less common, and it is not usually neces- sary to go further than the lung scan. In the presence of chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or significant asthma, the ventilation‚Äìperfusion lung scan is more likely to be equivocal, and further tests are more often used. In this case a com- puted tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was carried out (Figure¬†50.3). This showed a filling defect typical of an embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. A search for a source of emboli with a Doppler of the leg veins may help in some cases, and the find- ing of negative D-dimers in the blood makes intravascular thrombosis and embolism unlikely. Immediate management should involve heparin, usually as subcutaneous low-molecular- weight heparin. The anticoagulation can then transfer to warfarin, continued in a case like this for 6 months. Alternative modes of contraception should be discussed and advice given on alternating walking or other leg movements with her seated periods at work. Thrombolysis should be considered when there is haemodynamic compromise by a large embolus. Figure 50.3‚ÄÇ Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram.  Case 50:‚ÄÇ Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath 133 Key Points ‚Ä¢ In the presence of a normal chest X-ray and no chronic lung disease, the ventilation‚Äì¬≠ perfusion lung scan has good sensitivity and specificity. ‚Ä¢ The chest X-ray and ECG are often unhelpful in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. ‚Ä¢ CT pulmonary arteriogram is used when ventilation‚Äìperfusion scanning is likely to be unhelpful.   Case 51:‚ÄÇ Chest Pain 135 Case 51:‚ÄÇ Chest Pain History A 62-year-old man is admitted to hospital with chest pain. The pain is in the centre of the chest and has lasted for 3‚Äâh by the time of his arrival in the emergency department. The chest pain radiated to the jaw and left shoulder. He felt sick at the same time. He has a history of chest pain on exercise, which has been present for 6 months. He has smoked 10 cigarettes daily for 40 years and does not drink alcohol. He has been treated with aspirin and with beta-blockers regularly for the last 2 years and has been given a glyceryl trinitrate spray to use as needed. This turns out to be two or three times a week. His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 66 years, and his 65-year-old brother had a coronary artery bypass graft 4¬†years ago. He has no other previous medical history. He works as a security guard. History An 82-year-old man is sent to the emergency department by his general practitioner (GP). The man is complaining of weakness and general malaise. He has complained of general pains in the muscles, and he also has some pains in the joints, particularly the elbows, wrists and knees. Three weeks earlier, he fell and hit his leg and has some local pain related to this. He is a non-smoker who does not drink any alcohol and has not been on any medication. Twelve years ago he had a myocardial infarction and was put on a beta-blocker, but he has not had a prescription for this in the last 6 years. Twenty years ago he had a cholecystectomy. He used to work as a labourer until his retirement at the age of 63 years. He lives alone in a second-floor flat. His wife died 5 years ago. He has one son who lives in Ireland and whom he has not seen for 3 years.","Examination He is sweaty and in pain but has no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory sys- tems. His blood pressure is 138/82‚ÄâmmHg, and his pulse rate is 110/min and regular. Investigations His electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure¬†51.1. He was given analgesia and underwent emergency primary angioplasty and stenting to a severe left anterior coronary artery lesion, and clopidrogel was added to his treatment. His pain settled and after two days he began to mobilize. On the fourth day after admission, he became more unwell. On examination, now his jugular venous pressure is raised to 6‚Äâcm above the manubrioster- nal angle. His blood pressure is 102/64‚ÄâmmHg; pulse rate is 106/min and regular. His tem- perature is 37.8¬∞C. On auscultation of the heart, there is a loud systolic murmur heard all over the praecordium. In the respiratory system, there are late inspiratory crackles at the lung bases, and these are heard up to the midzones. There are no new abnormalities to find elsewhere on examination. His chest X-ray is shown in Figure¬†51.2. Examination He is tender over the muscles around his limb girdles, and there is a little tenderness over the elbows, wrists and knees. The mouth looks normal except that his tongue appears rather smooth. He has no teeth and has lost his dentures. There are no other abnormalities to find in the cardiovascular, respiratory or alimentary systems. In the legs, he has a superficial lacera- tion on the front of the right shin. This is oozing blood and has not healed. There is a petechial rash around the ankles. There are some larger areas of bruising on the arms and the legs, which he says have not been associated with any trauma.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the likely diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How can it be confirmed?

Figure 51.2‚ÄÇ Chest X-ray.  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 136,"ANSWER 50 This woman has had a sudden onset of pleuritic pain, breathlessness and cough. The physical signs of tachypnoea, tachycardia, raised jugular venous pressure and pleural rub would fit with a diagnosis of a pulmonary embolus. The peak flow of 410‚ÄâL/min indicates that asthma does not explain her breathlessness. The differential diagnosis would include pneumonia, pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism. The clinical signs do not suggest pneumothorax or pneumonia. Possible pre- disposing factors for pulmonary embolism are the history of a long aeroplane journey 3 weeks earlier, oral contraception and her work involving sitting for prolonged periods. Other predisposing factors, such as intravenous drug abuse, should be considered. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia. The often-quoted pattern of S-wave in lead I, Q-wave and T inversion in lead III (S1Q3T3) is not common except with massive pulmonary embolus. Other signs, such as transient right ventricular hypertrophy features, P pulmonale and T-wave changes, may also occur. The chest X-ray is normal, ruling out pneumothorax and lobar pneumonia. A ventilation‚Äìperfusion lung scan could be done looking for a typical mismatch with an area that is ventilated but not perfused. This result would have a high probability for a diagno- sis of pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary arteriogram has been the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for the diagnosis of embolism but is a more invasive test. In cases with a normal chest X-ray and no ANSWER 51 This 62-year-old man had an anteroseptal myocardial infarction, indicated by Q-waves in V2 and V3 and raised ST segments in V2, V3, V4 and V5. He became unwell suddenly 4¬†days later having had no initial problems. The late inspiratory crackles are typical of pul- monary oedema, and the chest X-ray confirms this, showing hilar flare with some alveolar filling, Kerley B lines at the lung bases and blunting of the costophrenic angles with small pleural effusions. The problems likely to occur at this time and produce shortness of breath are a further myo- cardial infarction, arrhythmias, rupture of the chordae tendinae of the mitral valve, perfo- ration of the intraventricular septum or even the free wall of the ventricle, and pulmonary emboli. The first four of these could produce pulmonary oedema and a raised jugular venous pressure, as in this man. Pulmonary embolism would be compatible with a raised jugular venous pressure but not the findings of pulmonary oedema on examination and X-ray. Acute mitral regurgitation from chordal rupture and ischaemic perforation of the interven- tricular septum both produce a loud pansystolic murmur. The site of maximum intensity of the murmur may differ, being apical with chordal rupture and at the lower left sternal edge with ventricular septal defect, but this differentiation may not be possible with a loud mur- mur. The differentiation can be made by echocardiography. The management of acute ventricular septal defect or chordal rupture would be similar and should involve consultation with the cardiac surgeons. When these lesions produce haemo- dynamic problems, as in this case, surgical repair is needed, either acutely if the problem is very severe or after stabilization with antifailure treatment or even counterpulsation with an aortic balloon pump. Milder degrees of failure with a pansystolic murmur may occur when there is ischaemia of the papillary muscles of the mitral valve. This is managed with anti- failure treatment, not surgical intervention, and can be differentiated by echocardiography. Key Points ‚Ä¢ The cause of breathlessness after myocardial infarction needs careful evaluation. ‚Ä¢ The signs of ischaemic ventricular septal defect and mitral regurgitation due to chordal rupture after myocardial infarction may be very difficult to differentiate. ‚Ä¢ Patients with angina or myocardial infarction can also present with the radiating pain but no central chest pain or with only the cardiac effects and no pain at all.

"History A 22-year-old woman complains of tiredness for 6 months. Her only other symptom is a gradual increase in frequency of bowel movements from once a day in her teens to two to three times daily. She has no abdominal pain and has no change in appetite. She says that the bowel movements can be difficult to flush away on occasions, but this is not a consistent problem. She is a non-smoker and drinks rarely. She has been a vegetarian for 5 years but eats dairy foods and fish regularly. She thinks that her grandmother, who lived in Ireland, had some bowel problems, but she died 3 years ago, at aged 68. She is an infant-school teacher and spends a lot of her spare time in keep-fit classes and routines at a local gym. She enjoys her work and socializes regularly with a wide circle of friends. History A 45-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with pneumonia. She has had three epi- sodes of cough, fever and purulent sputum over the last 6 months. One of these was associated with right-sided pleuritic chest pain. These have been treated at home by her general practitioner (GP). In addition she has a 5-year history of difficulty with swal- lowing. Initially this was mild, but it has become progressively worse. She says that food seems to stick in the low retrosternal area. This applies to all types of solid food. She has lost 5 kg in weight over the last 2 months. Sometimes the difficulty with swallowing seems to improve during a meal. Recently she has had trouble with regurgitation and vomiting of recognizable food. Three years ago her GP arranged for an outpatient upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which was normal. She was reassured, but the problem has increased in severity. There is no other relevant medical history or family history. She lived in the north-western coast of the United States for 4 years until 10 years ago. She works as a shop assistant. She has never smoked and drinks less than 5 units of alcohol each week. There has been no disturbance of micturition. She has always tended to be constipated, and this has been a little worse recently. History A 74-year-old woman presents as an emergency having suddenly developed a severe head- ache whilst shovelling snow in her drive. She does not recollect being taken to the hospital. The ambulance was called by the neighbours who witnessed the woman having generalised seizures. She now describes the pain as the worst headache that she has ever experienced. It is a generalised headache. She cannot tolerate bright light. She had a similar milder head- ache about 10 days earlier. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension. She smokes 20 cigarettes/day. History A 29-year-old man presents with a cough and some mild aches in the hands, wrists and ankles. The symptoms have been present for 2 months and have increased slightly over that time. Six weeks before, he had some soreness of his eyes, which resolved in 1 week. The cough has been non-productive. He had noticed some skin lesions on the edge of the hairline and around his nostrils. Previously he had been well apart from an appendicectomy at the age of 17 years. He was born in Trinidad and came to the United Kingdom at the age of 4 years. His two brothers and parents are well. He does not smoke, is a teetotaller, and takes no recreational drugs. He works as a messenger and took regular exercise until the last few weeks. History A 63-year-old woman is referred to a nephrologist for investigation of polyuria. About 4¬†weeks ago she developed abrupt-onset extreme thirst and polyuria. She is getting up to pass urine five times a night. Over the past 3 months she has felt generally unwell and noted pain in her back. She has lost 3‚Äâkg in weight over this time. She also has a persistent frontal headache associated with early morning nausea. The headache is worsened by coughing or lying down. Eight years previously she had a left mastectomy and radiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast. She is a retired civil servant who is a non-smoker and drinks 10 units of alcohol per week. She is on no medication. History A 52-year-old businessman is referred to a nephrologist for investigation of microscopic hae- maturia. This was first detected 6 months ago at an insurance medical for a new job and has since been confirmed on two occasions by his general practitioner (GP). His blood pressure was mildly elevated as his last medical exam. Previous urinalyses have been normal. He has never had macroscopic haematuria and has no urinary symptoms. He is otherwise in excel- lent health. There is no significant past medical history. He has no symptoms of visual prob- lems or deafness. There is no family history of renal disease. He drinks 35 units of alcohol per week and smokes 30 cigarettes per day.","Examination She is 1.62‚Äâm (5‚Äâft 4‚Äâin.) tall and weighs 49‚Äâkg. She looks a little pale and thin.

The report of a dimorphic blood film means that there are both small and large cells. This suggests that the anaemia is caused by a combination of the folate deficiency indicated by the red cell folate and by iron deficiency. The Howell‚ÄìJolly bodies are dark blue regular inclusions in the red cells that are typically found in the blood of patients after splenectomy or are associated with the splenic atrophy characteristic of coeliac disease. In coeliac disease, there is a sensitiv- ity to dietary gluten, a water-insoluble protein found in many cereals. The proximal small bowel is the main site involved with loss of villi and an inflammatory infiltrate causing reduced absorption. The MCV is at the upper limit of normal. ! Causes of macrocytosis in the blood film ‚Ä¢ Folate deficiency ‚Ä¢ Vitamin B12 deficiency ‚Ä¢ Excessive alcohol consumption ‚Ä¢ Hypothyroidism ‚Ä¢ Certain drugs (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate) ‚Ä¢ Primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes Coeliac disease is made more likely by a possible positive family history and the origin from Ireland, where coeliac disease is four times as common as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Other diagnoses that might be considered are anorexia nervosa (her age and sex, commit- ment to exercise); she does not appear depressed (a common cause of weight loss and bowel disturbance), and the laboratory findings clearly indicate physical disease. Diagnosis of coeliac disease can be confirmed by endoscopy, at which a biopsy can be taken from the distal duodenum. Typically this will show complete villus atrophy. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase and IgA endomysial antibodies are usually positive when the patient is still in a gluten containing diet and are a useful screening test. Treatment is a gluten-free diet with a repeat of the biopsy some months later to show improvement in the height of the villi in the small bowel. In some cases, temporary treatment with steroids may be needed to help recovery. A common cause of failure to recover the villus architecture is poor compliance to the difficult dietary constraints. Symptoms may persist if patients have lactose intolerance or irritable bowel syndrome. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Howell‚ÄìJolly bodies are characteristic of hyposplenism. ‚Ä¢ Coeliac disease can present at any age with non-specific symptoms; absence of abdominal pain or steatorrhoea are not unusual. ‚Ä¢ Typical features of fat malabsorption may not be evident if the patient eats a diet with little or no fat intake.  Case 55:‚ÄÇ Recurrent Chest Infections 145 Case 55:‚ÄÇ Recurrent Chest Infections ANSWER 55 The likely diagnosis is achalasia of the cardia, a primary neurological disturbance of the nerve plexuses at the lower end of the oesophagus. The X-ray shows a dilated, fluid-filled oesophagus with no visible gastric air bubble. Endoscopy may be normal in the early stages, as in this case. The oesophagus has now dilated, and there has been spillover of stagnant food into the lungs, giving her the episodes of repeated respiratory infections. Such aspiration is most likely to affect the right lower lobe because of the more vertical right main bronchus, although the result of aspiration at night may depend on the position of the patient. The dysphagia is often variable early on. It tends to be present for all foods, indicating a motility problem, and there may initially be some relief from the mechani- cal load as the oesophagus fills. Dysphagia for bulky, solid foods first usually indicates an obstructive lesion. The diagnosis can be made at this stage by a barium swallow showing the dilated oesophagus. Earlier, it may require careful cine-radiology with a bolus of food impregnated with barium or oesophageal motility studies using a catheter fitted with a number of pressure sensors to detect the abnormal motility of the oesophageal muscle. A similar condition can be produced by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas‚Äô disease), but this is limited to South and Central America and would not be relevant to her stay in the north-western United States. Other common causes of dysphagia are benign oesophageal structures from acid reflux, malignant structures, external compression or an oesophageal pouch. Achalasia may be managed by muscle relaxants when mild, but often requires treatment to disrupt the lower oesophageal muscle by endoscopic dilation or surgery. Key Points ‚Ä¢ The subjective site of blockage in dysphagia may not reflect accurately the level of the obstruction. ‚Ä¢ Persistent dysphagia without explanation needs investigation by barium swallow or endoscopy.  Case 56:‚ÄÇ Headache 147 Case 56:‚ÄÇ Headache ANSWER 56 Headache is one of the commonest clinical complaints. The sudden onset of a headache within seconds or a few minutes is characteristic of a subarachnoid haemaorrhage (SAH). In contrast a migraine usually takes one to two hours to reach maximal intensity. The absence of a similar headache in the past also suggests a new pathology. Tension type headaches are the commonest headaches in the general population. The typi- cal presentation is of mild to moderate headache, nonthrobbing, bilateral with no associ- ated symptoms. Cluster headaches are characterised by attacks of severe unilateral orbital or temporal pain, accompanied by autonomic features such as nasal congestion, lacrimation and rhinorrhoea. Migraines are often preceded by characteristic symptoms such as flashing lights and are often unilateral. Nausea and photophobia may occur during an attack. Brain tumours cause headaches by causing raised intracranial pressure. The headache is worse after coughing and is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Patients with SAH often describe the pain as ‚Äòthe worst headache in my life‚Äô. Fever associ- ated with headache suggests an infective cause such as meningitis. A change in conscious level or personality suggests an underlying pathology. Rupture of an aneurysm leads to release of blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under arterial pressure. The bleeding probably only lasts for a few seconds, but rebleeding is common. The onset of headache may be localised to the side of the aneurysm and may be associated with a brief loss of consciousness, seizure, nausea and vomiting and neck stiffness. A significant minority of patients will have a minor haemorrhage causing a sudden and severe headache (the sentinel headache) within the 3 weeks leading up to the main SAH. Physical exertion may be a trig- ger. Risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, uncontrolled hypertension and a family history. On examination, conscious level may be reduced. There is neck stiffness and there may be preretinal haemorrhages. The key investigation is a noncontrast CT scan. The sensitivity of a head CT for detecting blood in the CSF is highest in the first 6‚Äì12 hours, and then declines rapidly over the next few days. Lumbar puncture is essential if there is a high clinical suspi- cion of a SAH haemorrhage with a normal CT. The usual findings are an elevated opening pressure and an elevated red blood cell count that does not decease after the initial few drops. Xanthochromia (red/yellow) suggests haemoglobin degradation products and is also sugges- tive of a recent subarachnoid haemorrhage. Once subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed digital subtraction angiography is performed to identify a potential bleeding point for inter- vention. About 15% of patients will not have an aneurysm on angiography. The main differential diagnoses of a SAH are a sentinel headache, cerebral venous thrombo- sis, acute hypertensive crisis and bacterial or viral meningitis. SAH is associated with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Complications include rebleeding, cere- bral infarction, hydrocephalus, cardiac ischaemia and hypothalamic dysfunction. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Sudden onset of severe headache should trigger investigation to rule out ¬≠subarachnoid haemorrhage. ‚Ä¢ A sentinel headache often precedes a severe subarachnoid haemorrhage.  Case 57:‚ÄÇ Cough and Joint Pains 149 Case 57:‚ÄÇ Cough and Joint Pains ANSWER 57 The likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. The age is typical, and sarcoidosis is more common in those of African-Caribbean origin. The chest X-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The blood results show a slightly raised calcium level, which is related to vitamin D sensitivity in sarcoidosis, in which the granulomas hydroxylate 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihy- droxycholecalciferol. The ESR is raised, and some of the liver enzymes are around the upper limit of normal. The skin lesions at the hairline and the nostrils are typical sites for sarcoid skin problems. The eye trouble 6 weeks earlier might also have been a manifestation of sar- coidosis, which can cause both anterior and posterior uveitis. An alternative diagnosis that might explain the findings is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can also cause hypercalcaemia, although this is much less common than in sarcoidosis. Tumours, especially lymphoma, might give this X-ray appearance but would not explain the other find- ings. The arthralgia (pains with no evidence of acute inflammation or deformity on examina- tion) can occur in sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, but again they are commoner in sarcoidosis. The ESR is non-specific. Arthralgia without deformity in an African-Caribbean man raises the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this would be much commoner in women and would not cause bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. He is likely to have had BCG (bacille Calmette‚ÄìGu√®rin) vaccination at school at around the age of 12 years, giving a degree of protection against tuberculosis. A tuberculin test should be positive after BCG, strongly positive in most cases of tuberculosis and negative in 80 per cent of cases of sarcoidosis. The serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme would be raised in over 80 per cent of cases of sarcoidosis but often in tuberculosis also; the granuloma cells secrete this enzyme. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest will confirm the extent of the lymphadenopathy and show whether there is any involvement of the lung parenchyma. Histology of affected tissue would confirm the clinical diagnosis. This might be obtained by a skin biopsy of one of the lesions. A bronchial or transbronchial lung biopsy at fibre-optic bronchoscopy would be another means of obtaining diagnostic histology. In patients with a cough and sarcoidosis, the bronchial mucosa itself often looks abnormal, and biopsy will pro- vide the diagnosis. Lung function tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed as a baseline if the diagnosis is confirmed. Steroid treatment would not be necessary for the hilar lymphadenopathy alone but would be indicated for the hypercalcaemia and possibly for the systemic symptoms. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Sarcoidosis is commoner in those of African-Caribbean heritage. ‚Ä¢ Typical sites for skin lesions are around the nose and the hairline. ‚Ä¢ Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease and can affect most parts of the body.  Case 58:‚ÄÇ Thirst and Frequency 151 Case 58:‚ÄÇ Thirst and Frequency ANSWER 58 Polyuria is generally defined as a urine output >3litres a day in adults. True polyuria must be distinguished from frequency and nocturia which are generally due to bladder or prostate conditions. This woman has mild hypercalcaemia, but this is not high enough to explain her extreme thirst and polyuria. It is more likely that she has polyuria due to neurogenic diabetes insipidus as a result of secondary metastases in her hypothalamus. The hypercalcae- mia and raised alkaline phosphatase are suggestive of bony metastases secondary to her breast carcinoma. The recent-onset headache, worsened by coughing and lying down and associated with vomiting, is characteristic of raised intracranial pressure, which is con- firmed by the presence of papilloedema. In some tumours around the pituitary there may be compression of the optic nerve, causing visual field abnormalities. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is due to inadequate arginine vasopressin (AVP, antidiuretic hormone) secretion. About 30 per cent of cases of neurogenic diabetes insipidus are idiopathic. The remaining causes are neoplastic; infectious; inflammatory (granulomas); traumatic (neurosurgery, deceleration injury); or vascular (cerebral haemorrhage, infarction). Patients with central diabetes insipidus typically describe an abrupt onset of polyuria and polydipsia. This is because urinary concentration can be maintained fairly well until the number of AVP-secreting neurones in the hypothalamus decreases to 10‚Äì15 per cent of the normal number, after which AVP levels decrease to a range where urine output increases dramatically. ! Major causes of polyuria and polydipsia ‚Ä¢ Solute diuresis (e.g. diabetes mellitus) ‚Ä¢ Renal diseases that impair urinary concentrating mechanisms (e.g. chronic renal failure), e.g. chronic renal failure. ‚Ä¢ Drinking abnormalities: psychogenic polydipsia ‚Ä¢ Renal resistance to the action of AVP ‚Ä¢ Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (due to inherited defects in either the AVP V2 receptor or the aquaporin-2 receptor) ‚Ä¢ Hypokalaemia ‚Ä¢ Hypercalcaemia ‚Ä¢ Drugs (e.g. lithium, demeclocycline) A water-deprivation test should be performed in this patient, measuring the plasma sodium, urine volume and urine osmolality until the sodium rises above 146‚Äâmmol/L, or the urine osmolality reaches a plateau and the patient has lost at least 2 per cent of body weight. At this point AVP is measured, and the response to subcutaneous desmopressin is measured. An increase in urine osmolality >50 per cent indicates central diabetes insipidus and <10 per cent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The hypothalamus should be imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and bone X-rays and bone scans should be performed to identify metastases (Figure¬†58.1). The MRI scan (T1-weighted coronal image) through the pituitary in Figure¬†58.1 shows thickening of the pituitary stalk due to metastatic disease (short arrow) and partial replacement of the normal bone marrow of the clivus by metastatic tumour (long arrow). Treatment of the neurogenic diabetes insipidus involves regular intranasal DDAVP  Case 58:‚ÄÇ Thirst and Frequency 153 (l-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin). She should be referred to an oncologist for treatment of her metastatic carcinoma. Key Points ‚Ä¢ The commonest causes of polyuria are diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. ‚Ä¢ True polyuria must be distinguished from frequency and nocturia due to lower urinary tract pathology. ‚Ä¢ Breast carcinoma may recur after several years of remission.

History An 85-year-old woman attends her GP with her daughter. Her daughter says she is becoming more forgetful. On two occasions she has left the gas on the hob. She leaves the house but then can‚Äôt remember why she left. She has become lost and been returned home by the police. She used to be diligent with her finances but recently her daughter found piles of unpaid bills. Her mother admits she gets a bit muddled trying to add up the amounts. Her writing has deteriorated and she struggles to think of the correct words. Her daughter says her mother can remember events from her earlier life fairly well but her short-term memory has gotten worse in the last 12 months. There has been no change in mood or appetite. There have been no hallucinations or delusions. Her mother has had no significant past medical history and has rarely needed to see doctors.,"Examination The examination of nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is entirely normal. Fundoscopy is normal. Abbreviated mental test scoring is grossly subnormal (3 out of 10). ! Mini-mental state questionnaire ‚Ä¢ What is the name of this place? ‚Ä¢ Can you remember this address I will give to you, ‚Äò42 West Street‚Äô? ‚Ä¢ What is the time? ‚Ä¢ What year is it? ‚Ä¢ What is my occupation? ‚Ä¢ How old are you? ‚Ä¢ When is your birthday? ‚Ä¢ What year did World War II start and end? ‚Ä¢ Who is the name of the current monarch? ‚Ä¢ Who was the previous prime minister? examination (MMSE) was performed and confirmed severe cognitive impairment. In this patient the diagnosis is dementia, with gradual decline in a number of higher centre cogni- tive domains (language, orientation, calculation, memory). Dementia needs to be distinguished from delirium and depression. Dementia is a progressive decline in mental ability affecting intellect, behaviour and personality. In delirium, patients are acutely confused, inattentive and often have visual hallucinations. Delirium is usually reversible once the underlying cause is addressed (commonly infection, dehydration, med- ication and constipation). Patients with dementia are particularly vulnerable to delirium. Depression may mimic dementia (pseudo-dementia), as it can cause severe retardation of cognitive, vocabulary and motor functions. Depressed patients may score poorly on the abbreviated mental state test if they are rushed. Pseudo-dementia from depression is revers- ible with anti-depressant therapy. Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by many diseases. The commonest cause of dementia is Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). Progressive neuronal damage in AD occurs due to the accumulation of beta amyloid peptide with the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibril- lary tangles. The cause is not known. AD often begins as subtle forgetfulness and progresses over time such that patients lose their short-term memory, vocabulary, orientation. Later, long-term memory maybe lost, with an inability to remember relatives‚Äô names or perform everyday tasks. In the latter stages of AD, patients may not attend to personal hygiene, diet or liquid intake. The average time of death from diagnosis is 7 years. ! Causes of dementia ‚Ä¢ Alzheimer‚Äôs disease ‚Ä¢ Multi-infarct dementia ‚Ä¢ As part of progressive neurological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis) ‚Ä¢ Normal-pressure hydrocephalus: dementia, ataxia, urinary incontinence ‚Ä¢ Neurosyphilis: general paralysis of the insane ‚Ä¢ Vitamin B12 deficiency ‚Ä¢ Intracranial tumours; subdural haematomas ‚Ä¢ Hypothyroidism ‚Ä¢ AIDS dementia The investigations in this patient should include a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate, serum urea and electrolytes, serum calcium, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis, vitamin B12 and folic acid, HIV serology and computed tomography (CT) of the head. In AD, the CT scan is usually normal or shows cerebral atrophy. Detailed neurocognitive testing may be helpful to identify the cause of dementia and can be used to detect early disease. Oral cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are modestly effective in treating AD, and may delay the need for nursing home care. Memantidine is an N-methyl- D-aspartate antagonist, which alone or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor is  Case 62:‚ÄÇ Memory Loss 163 effective in moderate to severe AD. Special help is available in the UK for those caring for relatives with dementia. Help includes community occupational therapy, physiotherapy, community psychiatric team, an attendance allowance, respite care, daycare or lunch clubs, priority parking and carer support groups. Specialist memory clinics offer multi-disciplinary advice on treatment and support available.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What are the major differential diagnoses of this condition? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 162,ANSWER 62 The abbreviated mental test score is a screening test for cognitive impairment.

"History A 63-year-old man in police custody is brought to the emergency department because of palpitations. The palpitations are uncomfortable, rapid and began 2 hours ago whilst in the police station. He has had episodes of palpations in the past. He has no chest pain or dyspnoea. He has a background of alcohol misuse and drinks 12 units of beer a day. He has type 2 dia- betes mellitus, hypertension and asthma. He is not always adherent with his medications, which include metformin, gliclazide, ramipril, a salbutamol metered dose inhaler and a sal- meterol with fluticasone metered dose inhaler.","Examination He is conscious and smells of alcohol. His pulse is 185/minute and irregular, blood pressure is 126/73‚ÄâmmHg and respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Jugular venous pulse is not elevated. Heart sounds are normal with no added sounds. Breath sounds are normal with no added sounds.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What does the ECG show? ‚Ä¢ What is the appropriate management of this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 168,"ANSWER 64 The ECG shows atrial fibrillation (AF) evidenced by a narrow complex irregular tachycardia with no distinct p-waves. The previous episodes of palpitations are consistent with paroxys- mal AF. The most likely cause for AF in this patient is hypertensive heart disease. Alcohol may be a trigger for atrial fibrillation. Other common causes include coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease. In younger patients conduction abnormalities such as Wolff‚Äì Parkinson‚ÄìWhite (WPW) syndrome need to be considered. In WPW, a delta wave or short PR interval may be present on the ECG while the patient is in sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrilla- tion can be secondary to a pulmonary embolism, hyperthyroidism, chronic lung disease and electrolyte abnormalities. Investigations should include measurement of electrolytes, thy- roid function tests and a chest radiograph. An echocardiogram should be considered in this patient, as structural heart disease is common in older patients. If coronary artery disease is suspected then a cardiac stress test should be performed. Atrial fibrillation can be classified as detected AF (first episode), paroxysmal AF (two or more episodes of AF) or persistent AF. Paroxysmal AF often evolves into persistent AF. In young patients without underlying structural heart disease the term ‚Äòlone AF‚Äô is used. Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic. AF causes a reduction of cardiac output, which may result in hypotension and acute heart failure. Symptoms include palpitations, dizziness, dys- pnoea and chest pain. AF also increases the risk of stroke. Thrombosis can form in the left atrial appendage and typically embolises to the cerebral arteries. Rarely, atrial thrombus can embolise to limbs or other organs. Persistent atrial fibrillation may cause structural changes to the heart muscle resulting in cardiomyopathy. Acute management of atrial fibrillation should be resuscitation and control of heart rate. DC cardioversion may be required immediately if the patient is hypotensive or in acute pulmo- nary oedema. A beta blocker is recommended to control heart rate in those who are haemo- dynamically stable. Alternative agents include flecainide (if no underlying coronary heart disease), calcium channel blocker (if a beta blocker is contraindicated), or amiodarone or digoxin (useful if the patient has mild heart failure). Treatment should also be directed to any underlying cause of AF such as ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism or pulmonary embolism. Long-term management of AF must include an assessment of thrombo-embolic risk and a decision regarding rate or rhythm control. The CHADS-2 score (see table¬†64.1) is used to calculate the risk of stroke associated with AF. Patients with a score of 1 or higher should receive long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. Newer anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, may be used as an alternative to warfarin. Unlike warfarin, dabigatran does not require regu- lar monitoring of coagulation. Those patients with a contraindication to anti-coagulation should receive anti-platelet therapy such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Those patients with a CHADS-2 score of 0 can receive an antiplatelet or no treatment. Patients with paroxysmal AF should be assessed for stroke risk in the same way as those with persistent AF.  Case 64:‚ÄÇ Palpitations 169 Table‚ÄØ64.1‚ÄÇ CHADS-2 Score Stroke Risk1 Congestive cardiac Failure (+1) Hypertension (+1) Age >75 years (+1) Diabetes (+1) Prior TIA or stroke (+2) Score 0 = 1.9% annual risk of stroke Score 1 = 2.8% annual risk of stroke Score 2 = 4.0% annual risk of stroke Score 3 = 5.9% annual risk of stroke Score 4 = 8.5% annual risk of stroke Score 5 = 12.5% annual risk of stroke Score 6 = 18.2% annual risk of stroke (Source: Gage BF, van Walraven C, Pearce L, et al. Selecting patients with atrial fibrillation for anticoagulation: stroke risk stratifica- tion in patients taking aspirin. Circulation 2004:110 (16);2287‚Äì 92. PMID 15477396.) The decision to control rate or rhythm is based on the patient‚Äôs age, length of time with AF and the presence of symptoms. There is no clear difference in mortality between a rate con- trol or rhythm control strategy. Rate control aims to keep the heart rate under 100 beats per minute without the restoration of sinus rhythm. In general, a rate control strategy is used in older patients with longstanding and usually asymptomatic AF. A rhythm control strategy aims to restore and maintain sinus rhythm and is used in younger patients who have recent onset AF and experience symptoms. Restoring sinus rhythm can be achieved using medica- tion (for example, amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide), elective DC cardioversion or by surgery. Surgery includes AV nodal ablation, pacing or pulmonary vein ablation. In this patient, rate control was achieved with a calcium channel blocker, as a beta-blocker was contraindicated due to his asthma. Although his CHADS-2 score was two, warfarin was not recommended because of his history of alcohol misuse and poor medication adherence. Aspirin was prescribed to reduce his thrombo-embolic risk. A proton pump inhibitor was prescribed with the aspirin to prevent aspirin-induced peptic ulcer disease."
"History A 24-year-old woman was attending her regular Sunday church service. During the singing of a hymn she suddenly fell to the ground without any loss of consciousness and told the other members of the congregation who rushed to her aid that she had complete paraly- sis of her left leg. She was unable to stand and was taken by ambulance to the emergency department. She has no other neurological symptoms and is otherwise healthy. She has no relevant past or family history, is on no medication, and has never smoked or drunk alcohol. She works as a sales assistant in a bookshop and until recently lived in a flat with a partner of 3 years‚Äô standing until they split up 4 weeks previously. She has moved back in with her parents.","Examination She looks well and is in no distress, making light of her condition with the staff. The only abnormalities are in the nervous system. She is completely oriented and the Mini-Mental State score is normal. The cranial nerves and the neurology of the upper limbs and right leg are normal. The left leg is completely still during the examination, and the patient is unable to move it on request. Tone is normal; coordination could not be tested because of the paralysis. Superficial sensation was completely absent below the margin of the left buttock and the left groin, with a clear transition to normal above this circumference at the top of the left leg. Vibration and joint position sense were completely absent in the left leg. There was normal withdrawal of the leg to nociceptive stimuli such as firm stroking of the sole and increasing compression of the Achilles‚Äô tendon. The superficial reflexes and tendon reflexes were nor- mal, and the plantar response was flexor. examination excludes organic lesions. It is important to realize that this disorder is distinct from malingering and factitious disease. The condition is real to patients, and they must not be told that they are faking illness or wasting the time of staff. The management is to explain the dissociation‚Äîin this case it is between her will to move her leg and its failure to respond‚Äîas being due to stress, and that there is no underlying serious disease such as multiple sclerosis. A very positive attitude that she will recover is essential, and it is important to reinforce this with appropriate physical treatment, in this case physiotherapy. The prognosis in cases of recent onset is good, and this patient made a complete recovery in 8 days. Dissociative disorder frequently presents with neurological symptoms, and the commonest of these are convulsions, blindness, pain and amnesia. Clearly some of these will require full neurological investigation to exclude organic disease.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you manage this case?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 182,"ANSWER 70 This patient has hysteria, now renamed dissociative disorder. The clues to this are the cluster of ‚Ä¢ the bizarre complex of neurological symptoms and signs that do not fit neuroanatomi- cal principles (e.g. the reflex responses and withdrawal to stimuli despite the paralysis) ‚Ä¢ the patient‚Äôs lack of concern, known by the French term of la belle indifference ‚Ä¢ the onset in relation to stress (i.e. the loss of her partner) ‚Ä¢ secondary gain: removing herself from the parental home, which is a painful reminder of her splitting from her partner None of these on its own is specific for the diagnosis, but put together they are typical. In any case of dissociative disorder, the diagnosis is one of exclusion; in this case the neurological"
"History A 21-year-old man is brought in to hospital at 5 pm. He was found unconscious in his flat by his girlfriend. She had last seen him at 8 pm the evening before when they came home after Christmas shopping. When she came to see him the next afternoon, she found him unconscious on the bathroom floor. He had been well previously, with no known medi- cal history. There was a family history of diabetes mellitus in his father and one of his two brothers. His girlfriend said that he had shown no signs of unusual mood on the previous day. He had his end-of-term examinations in psychology coming up in 1 week and was anxious about these, but his studies seemed to be going well, and there had been no problems with previous examinations. He is a non-smoker. He drinks around 10 units of alcohol most weeks with occasional binges. He has taken ecstasy tablets in the past but has never used intravenous drugs.","Examination He looks pale. There are no marks of recent intravenous injections. His pulse is 92/min, blood pressure is 114/74‚ÄâmmHg, and respiratory rate is 22/min. There are no abnormalities found in the cardiovascular or respiratory system. In the nervous system, there is no response to verbal commands. Appropriate withdrawal movements are made in response to pain. The reflexes are brisk and symmetrical; plantars are downgoing. The pupils are dilated but responsive to light. In the fundi, the optic discs appear swollen.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What are the most likely diagnoses? ‚Ä¢ What other investigations should be done immediately?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 192,"ANSWER 75 This young man has been brought in unconscious, having been well less than 24‚Äâh previously. The most likely diagnoses are related to drugs or a neurological event. The first part of the care should be to ensure that he is stable from a cardiac and respiratory point of view. His respiratory rate is a little high. Blood gases should be measured to monitor oxygenation and ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not high, suggesting hypoventilation. The family history of diabetes raises the possibility that his problem is related to this. However, the speed of onset makes hyperglycaemic coma unlikely. One would expect a slower develop- ment with a history of thirst and polyuria over the last day or so. However, the blood sugar should certainly be checked. Hypoglycaemia comes on faster but would not occur as a new event in diabetes mellitus. It might occur as a manifestation of a rare condition such as an insulinoma. Other metabolic causes of coma, such as abnormal levels of sodium or calcium, should be checked. A neurological problem such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage is possible as a sudden unex- pected event in a young person. Where the level of consciousness is so affected, some local- izing signs or subhyaloid haemorrhage in the fundi might be expected. If no other cause is evident from the initial investigations, a computed tomography (CT) scan might be indicated. The most likely cause is that the loss of consciousness is drug related. Despite the lack of any warning of intent beforehand, drug overdose is common, and the question of availability of any medication should be explored further. This would be likely to be a sedative drug. If there is any suspicion of this, then levels of other drugs that might need treatment should be measured (e.g. aspirin and paracetamol). The other possibility in somebody brought in unconscious is that they are suffering from car- bon monoxide poisoning. The fact that it is winter and he was found in the bathroom where a faulty gas-fired heater might be situated increases this possibility. Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning are usually pale rather than the traditional cherry-red colour associated with carboxyhaemoglobin. Papilloedema can occur in severe carbon monoxide poisoning and might account for the swollen appearance of the optic discs on funduscopy. Measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin showed a level of 32 per cent. He was treated with high levels of inspired oxygen and made a slow but full recovery over the next 48‚Äâh. Mannitol for cerebral oedema and hyperbaric oxygen are considerations in the management. The problem was traced to a faulty gas water heater that had not been serviced for 4 years."
"History A 38-year-old man has a 2-month history of abdominal pain. The pain is epigastric or cen- tral and is intermittent. He had a similar episode a year before. On that occasion he took some indigestion mixture obtained from a retail pharmacy, and the symptoms resolved after 10¬†weeks. The pain usually lasts for 30‚Äì60 min. It often occurs at night, when it can wake him up, and seems to improve after meals. Some foods, such as curries and other spicy foods, seem to bring on the pain on occasions. He has smoked 10‚Äì15 cigarettes per day for 25 years and drinks around 30 units of alcohol each week. He is not taking any medication at present. There is no other relevant medical his- tory. He works as a financial broker in the city. He has been feeling more tired recently and had put this down to the pressure of work. A blood count was sent. History A 72-year-old woman has felt non-specifically unwell for about 10 weeks. She feels stiff, espe- cially when she gets up in the morning. She struggles to get out of bed by herself. She has difficulty lifting her hand to comb her hair and has needed help with some of her housework. She has also noticed some pain in her knees and fingers. She has lost 4‚Äâkg in weight and has noticed some sweats, which seem to occur at night. She has come to see her general practi- tioner (GP) because she has now developed a headache. This is a severe pain that has been persistent over the last 4‚Äì5 days. On direct questioning she says that she has had some pain in her jaw when chewing. She has previously been fit with no significant past medical history. She lives alone. She has not smoked for 40 years, and she only drinks alcohol at Christmas. She is taking no regular medication. She has tried some paracetamol, but this has not helped the headache. History A 76-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of an episode of weakness in her right arm and leg. She was sitting down with her husband when the weakness came on, and her husband noticed that she slurred her speech. All of the symp- toms resolved within 10 min. Her husband has noticed two to three episodes of slurred speech lasting a few minutes over the last 6 months but had thought nothing of it. Two months earlier she had a sensation of darkness coming down over her left eye, lasting for a few minutes. She has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 6 years, controlled on diet. She is hypertensive and suffered a myocardial infarction 3 years previously. She smokes about 10 cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol rarely. Her only medication is enalapril for her blood pressure. History A 52-year-old man presents to the emergency department at 2 am vomiting fresh red blood. He is continuing to vomit large amounts of blood. He has no associated abdominal pain. His stools have been dark black for 48 hours. He has a history of hypertension for which he takes atenolol. He drinks a bottle of wine a day. History A 33-year-old housewife has noticed that she is becoming tired and having difficulty cop- ing with her two children, aged 6 and 4 years. She goes to see her general practitioner (GP) because she feels she may be suffering from anxiety and depression. She says that she has felt more irritable and anxious than usual. Her sleep is normal. Her appetite has been normal, but she has lost some weight. Her change in personality has been noticed by her husband and friends. She feels constantly restless and has difficulty concentrating on a subject for more than a few moments. Her increased anxiety has developed over the past 3 months. She has also noticed an increased frequency of bowel movements. Her periods have become lighter and shorter. She feels extremely tired and thinks that she has been prone to sweat more than usual. She has had no significant illnesses previously. She is a non-smoker and drinks 10 units of alcohol per week. History A 48-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness of his legs. Four weeks earlier he had an episode of gastroenteritis that lasted 4‚Äì5 days. Four days before admission he had a feeling that there was something wrong in his feet, and 3 days before admission he started to develop some difficulty in walking and this has progressed so that he now has difficulty standing. Both feet have also become painful over the last day or so. His bowels and bladder are functioning normally. He has no other significant medical history. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol and is taking no medication. He in a local supermarket.","Examination There is mild tenderness in the epigastrium, but no other abnormalities.

The high red cell count with low haemoglobin shows that the haemoglobin content of the cells is reduced. The low serum iron and ferritin with a high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) confirm that this is related to true iron deficiency. The blood film confirms that the cells are microcytic and low in haemoglobin (hypochromasia). In anaemia of chronic disease the cells may be microcytic and serum iron low, but the TIBC would be low also and ferritin normal. The diagnosis is most likely to be a peptic ulcer. The commonest cause of iron-deficiency anaemia in a man is gastrointestinal blood loss. In a premenopausal woman menstrual blood loss would be the commonest cause. The abdominal pains would be consistent with those from a peptic ulcer, especially a duodenal ulcer when there is more often some relief from food. The diagnosis should be established by endoscopy because alternative diagnoses such as carcinoma of the stomach cannot be ruled out from the history. The site of the blood loss causing the iron deficiency should be established. At the same time the presence of Helicobacter pylori should be investigated. In this case, an endoscopy confirmed an active duodenal ulcer, and samples were positive for Helicobacter pylori. This is associated with gastritis and with over 90 per cent of duode- nal ulcers. Tests of expired breath and serum antibodies are alternative diagnostic tests. The H.¬†pylori was treated by a combined regimen of omeprazole for 6 weeks and triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. For small (<1cm) uncompli- cated ulcers there is no indication for continuing proton pump inhibitors after completion of the course of antibiotics. By contrast, continuing antisecretory therapy until the cure of H. pylori is confirmed is important for complicated ulcers. He was given strong recommen- dations to stop smoking and to address his excessive alcohol consumption. The importance of stress as a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease remains controversial. The iron deficiency was corrected by additional oral iron, which was continued for 3 months to replenish the iron stores in the bone marrow. Patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcers who have been treated do not need further endoscopy unless symptoms persist. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Various antibiotic regimes have been shown to temporarily remove Helicobacter pylori and prevent or postpone recurrence of symptoms and ulceration. ‚Ä¢ Replenishment of iron stores in the bone marrow needs 3 months of treatment with oral iron after the haemoglobin has returned to normal. ‚Ä¢ Ferritin is an acute-phase protein and will be raised in the presence of acute ¬≠illness even in the presence of iron deficiency.  Case 82:‚ÄÇ Aches and Pains 205 Case 82:‚ÄÇ Aches and Pains ANSWER 82 This woman has the typical clinical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arte- ritis. Most patients are over 65 years. The onset of symptoms is often sudden. Patients may present primarily with polymyalgia-type symptoms (proximal muscle pain and stiffness most marked in the mornings) or temporal arteritis symptoms (severe head- aches with tenderness over the arteries involved). Patients may have systemic symp- toms, such as general malaise, weight loss and night sweats. Characteristically, the ESR is very elevated (at least 40‚Äâmm/h), and there is a mild anaemia and leucocytosis. The liver enzymes are often slightly raised. In polymyalgia, the main symptoms are muscle stiffness and pain, which may simulate muscle weakness. The creatine kinase is normal, unlike in polymyositis. The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is essentially a clinical diagnosis. A very elevated ESR is useful. Around 25 per cent of patients with giant cell arteritis have polymyalgia. When there are headaches and giant cell arteritis is suspected, a temporal artery biopsy should be performed. However, the histology may be normal because the vessel involvement with inflammation is patchy. Nevertheless, a positive result provides reassurance about the diag- nosis and the need for long-term steroids. This patient has clear evidence of giant cell arteritis (also known as temporal arteritis, although other vessels are involved) and is at risk of irreversible visual loss due to either ischaemic damage to the ciliary arteries causing optic neuritis or central retinal artery occlu- sion. The patient should immediately be started on high-dose prednisolone on the basis of the clinical picture before the biopsy is done. The results will not be affected by a few days of treatment and preservation of sight is the most important factor. The steroid dose should be slowly tapered according to clinical features and ESR but is likely to need to be continued for around 2 years. Bone protection measures should be part of the management. ! Differential diagnoses of proximal muscle weakness and stiffness ‚Ä¢ Polymyositis ‚Ä¢ Systemic vasculitis ‚Ä¢ Systemic lupus erythematosus ‚Ä¢ Parkinsonism ‚Ä¢ Hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism ‚Ä¢ Osteomalacia Key Points ‚Ä¢ Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis often coexist. ‚Ä¢ Patients with these conditions have markedly elevated ESR levels. ‚Ä¢ There is a risk of blindness in giant cell arteritis, and steroids should be started immediately.  Case 83:‚ÄÇ Weakness 207 Case 83:‚ÄÇ Weakness ANSWER 83 This woman gives a history of transient neurological symptoms with no residual signs. She is at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease because of her smoking, hypertension and dia- betes. She is describing recurrent transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), which by definition resolve completely in less than 24‚Äâh and, in practice, often much quicker. Two months before her admission she had an episode of amaurosis fugax (transient uniocular blindness) which is often described as like a shutter coming down over the visual field of one eye. The TIAs are affecting the left cerebral hemisphere in the area of brain supplied by the left carotid artery, causing right-sided weakness and dysarthria. TIAs may be caused by thromboembo- lism from ulcerated plaques in the carotid arteries or aortic arch, from cardiac sources such as a dilated left atrium, and more rarely due to haematological causes such as polycythaemia rubra vera, sickle cell disease or hyperviscosity due to myeloma. The symptoms may be the same each time or vary. Her ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and she has the signs of mitral regurgitation with a pansystolic murmur and displaced apex beat. There are three obvious potential sources for emboli: ‚Ä¢ a left carotid artery stenosis (in a correct location to account for the distribution of these TIAs and more likely in the presence of a carotid bruit) ‚Ä¢ the left atrium in atrial fibrillation with clinically evident mitral regurgitation ‚Ä¢ a previous myocardial infarction with mural thrombosis. ! Major causes of transient neurological syndromes ‚Ä¢	Migraine: the aura of migraine is a spreading and slowly intensifying phenom- enon, and the symptoms are usually positive (e.g. scotomata). The aura is usually followed by a severe headache. However, migraines can be associated with focal neurological deficits (e.g. hemiplegia). ‚Ä¢	Focal epilepsy: this also normally causes positive symptoms such as twitching and sensory symptoms, which may march up one limb and from one limb to another on the same side. ‚Ä¢	Syncope: unlike most TIAs there is loss of consciousness, but there are usually no focal signs. Dizziness often precedes the attack. ‚Ä¢	Space-occupying lesion: a cerebral tumour or abscess can produce fluctuating symptoms and signs. The symptoms are usually more gradual in onset and are often associated with headaches or personality changes. ‚Ä¢	Miscellaneous: hysteria, cervical spondylosis, hypoglycaemia and cataplexy. This patient should be investigated with computed tomography (CT) of the head to exclude a structural space-occupying lesion; echocardiography to assess left-atrial size, the mitral valve (to exclude infective valvular vegetations) and to rule out thrombus in the left ventricle related to the previous infarct; and a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries. If a critical carotid stenosis (>70 per cent) is present, carotid endarterectomy should be considered. The patient should be anticoagulated with warfarin because of her atrial fibrillation and carotid stenosis. Her blood pressure and diabetes should be carefully controlled and her lipids mea- sured and treated if appropriate.  Case 83:‚ÄÇ Weakness 209 Key Points ‚Ä¢ Most transient ischaemic attacks persist for only a few minutes. ‚Ä¢ Approximately 40 per cent of patients with cerebral infarction have a prior history of transient ischaemic attacks. ‚Ä¢ Multiple risk factors need to be taken into account in the investigation and ¬≠management of vascular disease.   Case 84:‚ÄÇ Vomiting 211 Case 84:‚ÄÇ Vomiting ANSWER 84 The most likely diagnosis is a variceal bleed due to underlying chronic liver disease sec- ondary to alcohol. He has signs of chronic liver disease and his liver function tests are consistent with this. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver disease include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory‚ÄìWeiss tear, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Thrombocytopenia is common in cirrhosis due to a combination of reduced thrombopoietin levels, splenic sequestration of platelets and bone marrow suppression. The estimation of blood loss is often difficult from a patient‚Äôs story. Haematemesis is a fright- ening symptom and the amount may be overestimated. The haemoglobin level in this case is low and there is significant postural hypotension. His pulse is not fast as he is taking a beta blocker. He has signs of chronic liver disease. This is likely to be a very serious bleed. Only 50% of patients with varcieal haemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously, and there is a very high risk of bleeding in the next 6 weeks. The patient needs to be resuscitated with transfusion via a large-bore peripheral intravenous line or a central line. FFP and platelets are needed to correct coagulopathy and thrombocy- topenia, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics reduce infectious complications in hospitalised cirrhotic patients. Endoscopy is required to identify the bleeding point. Bleeding oesophageal varices should be treated with oesophageal band ligation or sclerotherapy. Balloon tamponade is effective at achieving short-term haemostasis, and may be used until more definitive treatment is avail- able. Terlipressin or octreotide reduce bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts or surgery are reserved for patients who continue to bleed despite the above measures. After he has been stabilised he needs to be asked questions about his alcohol intake. He should be advised to abstain from alcohol. CAGE criteria consist of four questions and are commonly used as a screen for alcoholism: ‚Ä¢ Have you felt the need to Cut down drinking? ‚Ä¢ Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of drinking? ‚Ä¢ Have you had Guilty feelings about drinking? ‚Ä¢ Did you ever take a morning Eye opener? Key Points ‚Ä¢ Acute variceal bleeds are less likely to stop spontaneously than other upper ¬≠gastrointestinal haemorrhages. ‚Ä¢ The CAGE questionnaire is useful as a screening tool for alcoholism. ‚Ä¢ In some surveys alcohol is linked directly to around 25% of acute medical admissions.  Case 85:‚ÄÇ Tiredness and Irritability 213 Case 85:‚ÄÇ Tiredness and Irritability ANSWER 85 Although anxiety might produce some of these symptoms and signs, they fit much bet- ter with a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The neck should be examined carefully, and in this case there was a smooth goitre with no bruit over it. Blood tests showed a very low thyroxine-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and high free thyroxine (T4), confirm- ing the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism due to a diffuse toxic goitre (Graves‚Äô disease). Hyperthyroidism may mimic an anxiety neurosis with marked restlessness, irritability and distraction. The most helpful discriminatory symptoms are weight loss despite a normal appetite and preference for cold weather. The most helpful signs are goitre, espe- cially with a bruit audible over it, resting sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, tremor and eye signs. Eye signs that may be present include lid retraction (sclera visible below the upper lid), lid lag, proptosis, oedema of the eyelids, congestion of the conjunctiva and ophthalmoplegia. Atypical presentations of thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation in younger patients, unexplained weight loss, proximal myopathy or a toxic confusional state. The weakness here is suggestive of a proximal myopathy. The very low TSH level indicates a primary thyroid disease rather than the far less common overproduction of TSH by the anterior pituitary. ! Common causes of hyperthyroidism ‚Ä¢ Diffuse toxic goitre (Graves‚Äô disease) ‚Ä¢ Toxic nodular goitre ‚Ä¢	 multinodular goitre (Plummer‚Äôs disease) ‚Ä¢	 solitary toxic adenoma ‚Ä¢ Over-replacement with thyroxine Blood should be sent for thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which will be detected in patients with Graves‚Äô disease. Medical treatment for thyrotoxicosis involves the use of the antithyroid drugs such as carbimazole or propylthiouracil. These are given for 12‚Äì18 months, but there is a 50 per cent chance of disease recurrence on stopping the drugs. If this hap- pens, radioiodine or surgery is indicated. Beta-blockers can be used to rapidly improve the symptoms of sympathetic overactivity (tachycardia, tremor) while waiting for the antithyroid drugs to act. Radioiodine is effective, but there is a high incidence of late hypothyroidism. Surgery is indicated if medical treatment fails or if the gland is large and compressing sur- rounding structures. In severe exophthalmos there is a risk of corneal damage, and oph- thalmological advice should be sought. High-dose steroids, lateral tarsorrhaphy or orbital decompression may be needed. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Thyrotoxicosis may be difficult to differentiate from an anxiety state. In older patients, symptoms such as palpitations, breathlessness and oedema may predominate. ‚Ä¢ The commonest causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves‚Äô disease or a toxic nodular goitre.  Case 86:‚ÄÇ Weakness of the Legs 215 Case 86:‚ÄÇ Weakness of the Legs"
"History An 85-year-old man is admitted to hospital because of a fall, in which he has sustained a mild facial laceration. In his history it becomes evident that he has had around eight falls over the last 3 months. He says that the falls have occurred in the morning on most occasions but have occasionally occurred in the afternoon. He does not think that he has lost consciousness, although he does remember a sensation of dizziness with the falls. He says that the falls have not been associated with any chest pain or palpitations. He does not remember tripping or any other mechanical trigger to the falls. He seems to return to normal within a few minutes of the fall. On two or three occasions he has hurt his knees on falling, and on one other occa- sion he hit his head. He lives alone, and there have been no witnesses to any of the falls. He smokes five cigarettes a day and does not drink. He has an occasional cough with some white sputum, but he cannot remember whether he was coughing at the time of any of the falls. He was diagnosed as having hypertension at a routine well-man clinic 4 years ago and has been on treatment with a diuretic, bendrofluazide and doxazosin, for this. The blood pressure has been checked in the surgery on three or four occasions, and he was told that it has been well controlled. He was found to have a high fasting blood sugar 6 months before and had been advised to consume a diabetic diet. There is no relevant family history. He worked as a messenger until he retired at the age of 70 years.","Examination He looks well. His pulse is 90/min and irregular. The blood pressure is 134/84‚ÄâmmHg. The heart sounds are normal, and there is nothing abnormal to find on examination of the respi- ratory system or gastrointestinal system. There are no significant hypertensive changes in the fundi. In the nervous system, there is a little loss of sensation to light touch in the toes, but no other abnormalities.

The reduced tone and absent reflexes indicate that this is a lower motor neuron lesion. The sensory distur- bance is less severe, and he has a sensory level around L/3. This is the typical clinical picture of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (acute idiopathic inflammatory polyneuropathy). This disor- der is a polyneuropathy that develops usually over 2‚Äì3 weeks, but sometimes more rapidly. It most commonly follows Campylobacter gastroenteritis or a viral infection, and a fever is common. It predominantly causes a motor neuropathy, which can have a proximal, distal or generalized distribution. Distal paraesthesiae and sensory loss are common. Reflexes are lost early. Cranial and bulbar nerve paralysis may occur and respiratory muscle involvement can cause respiratory failure. The diagnosis is made from the clinical picture and can be con- firmed with examination of the CSF and from nerve conduction studies. The CSF protein is usually raised, but the cell count is usually normal, although there may be mild lymphocyto- sis. The disorder is probably due to a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction causing myelin to be stripped off the axons by mononuclear cells. ! Differential diagnoses of motor neuropathy ‚Ä¢ Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome ‚Ä¢ Lead poisoning ‚Ä¢ Diphtheria ‚Ä¢ Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy) ‚Ä¢ Poliomyelitis An acute-onset neuropathy suggests ‚Ä¢ Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome ‚Ä¢ porphyria ‚Ä¢ malignancy ‚Ä¢ some toxic neuropathies ‚Ä¢ diphtheria ‚Ä¢ botulism This patient should be referred to a neurologist for further investigation and management. In this patient who presents with weakness and sensory signs, it is important to make sure there is no evidence of spinal cord compression or multiple sclerosis. However, these would tend to cause hypertonia, hyper-reflexia and a more distinct sensory level. His respiratory function should be monitored with daily bedside spirometry, and temporary non-invasive ventilator support or intubation may be necessary. Supportive care is the most important element of treatment. He should also be treated with either plasma exchange or intravenous immuno- globulin, which will speed up recovery. Most patients recover over a period of several weeks. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome presents with predominantly a motor neuropathy, although sensory symptoms are usually present. ‚Ä¢ There is often a history of an infective illness in the previous 3 weeks, often Campylobacter jejuni.  Case 87:‚ÄÇ Recurrent Falls 217 Case 87:‚ÄÇ Recurrent Falls ANSWER 87 There are a number of possibilities to explain falls in the elderly. Some more information in the history about the circumstances of these falls would be helpful. On further enquiry, it emerges that the falls are most likely to occur when he gets up from bed first thing in the morning. The afternoon events have occurred on getting up from a chair after his post- lunch doze. These circumstances suggest a possible diagnosis of postural hypotension. This was verified by measurements of standing and lying blood pressure‚Äîthe diagnostic criteria are a drop of 15‚ÄâmmHg on standing for 3 min. This showed a marked postural drop, with blood pressure decreasing from 134/84 to 104/68‚ÄâmmHg. This is most likely to be caused by the antihypertensive treatment; both the alpha-blocker, which causes vasodilation, and the diuretic might contribute. Another possible candidate for a cause of the postural hypoten- sion is the diabetes, which could be associated with autonomic neuropathy. In this case the diabetes is not known to have been present for long, and there is evidence of only very mild peripheral sensory neuropathy. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is usually associated with quite severe peripheral sensory neuropathy, with or without motor neuropathy. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of sinoatrial node disease or sick sinus syn- drome. Clinically, it is easily mistaken for atrial fibrillation because of the irregular rhythm and the variation in strength of beats. The ECG shows a P-wave with each QRS complex, although the P-waves change in shape and timing. It may be associated with episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia, which could cause falls. This might be investigated further with a 24-h ambulatory recording of the ECG. Coughing bouts can cause falls through cough syncope. The positive intrathoracic pressure during coughing limits venous return to the heart. The cough is usually quite marked, and he might be expected to remember this since he gives a good account of the falls otherwise. Syncope can occur in association with micturition. Neck movements with vertebrobasilar dis- ease, poor eyesight and problems with balance are other common causes of falls in the elderly. A neurological cause, such as transient ischaemic episodes and epilepsy, is less likely with the lack of prior symptoms and the swift recovery with clear consciousness and no neurological signs. Another diagnosis that should be remembered in older people who fall is a subdural haema- toma. Symptoms may fluctuate, and this might be considered and ruled out with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. The doxazosin should be stopped and another antihypertensive agent started if necessary. This might be a beta-blocker, long-acting calcium antagonist or angiotensin converting- enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, although all these can cause postural drops in blood pressure. His symptoms all disappeared on withdrawal of the doxazosin. The blood pressure rose to 144/86‚ÄâmmHg lying and 142/84‚ÄâmmHg standing, indicating no significant postural hypoten- sion, with reasonable blood pressure control."
"History A 63-year-old woman is brought in to the surgery by her neighbour, who has been worried that she looks increasingly unwell. On direct questioning she says that she has felt increas- ingly tired for around 2 years. She has been off her food but is unclear whether she has lost any weight. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 8 years ago and has been on thyroxine replacement but has not had her blood tests checked for a few years. Her other complaints are of itching for 2‚Äì3 months, but she has not noticed any rash. She says that her mouth has been dry and, on direct questioning, thinks her eyes have also felt dry. There has been no disturbance of her bowels or urine, although she thinks that her urine has been rather ‚Äòstrong‚Äô lately. She is 14 years postmenopausal. There is a family history of thyroid disease and of diabetes. She does not smoke and drinks two glasses of sherry every week- end. She has never drunk more than this regularly. She has taken occasional paracetamol for headaches but has been on no regular medication other than thyroxine and some vitamin tablets she buys from the chemist.","Examination Her sclerae look a little yellow, and she has xanthelasmata around the eyes. There are some excoriated marks from scratching over her back and upper arms. The pulse is 74/min and regular; blood pressure is 128/76‚ÄâmmHg. No abnormalities are found in the cardiovascular or respiratory system. In the abdomen, the liver is not palpable, but the spleen is felt 2‚Äâcm under the left costal margin. It is not tender.

The symptoms (fatigue and pruritus) and investigations are characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis, an uncommon condition found mainly in middle-aged women. In the liver there is chronic inflammation around the small bile ducts in the portal tracts. Fatigue is often a major factor that can impair quality of life. Itching occurs because of raised levels of bile salts, and can be helped by the use of a binding agent such as cholestyramine which interferes with their reabsorption. Hypercholesterolaemia, xanthelasmata and xanthomata are common. About 25‚Äì50 per cent of newly diagnosed patients have hyperpigmetation of the skin due to melanin deposition.The dry eyes and dry mouth may occur as part of an associated sicca syndrome. The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies in the blood is typical of primary biliary cirrhosis. These antibodies are found in 95 per cent of cases. Hypothyroidism might explain some of her symptoms, but the normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level shows that her current dose of 150‚ÄâŒºg thyroxine is providing adequate replacement. The thyroid antibodies reflect the autoimmune thyroid disease, which is associ- ated with other autoantibody-linked conditions, such as primary biliary cirrhosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by a liver biopsy. This should be carried out only after an ultrasound confirms that there is no obstruction of larger bile ducts. Ultrasound will help to rule out other causes of obstructive jaundice, although the clinical picture described here is typical of pri- mary biliary cirrhosis. No treatment is known to affect the clinical course of this condition."
"History A 40-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department having been found uncon- scious at home by his wife on her return from work in the evening. He has suffered from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 24 years, and his diabetic control is poor. He has had recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes and has been treated in the emergency department on two occasions for this. Over the past few weeks he has developed pain in his right foot. His general practitioner diagnosed cellulitis, and he has received two courses of oral antibiotics. This has made him feel unwell, and he has complained to his wife of fatigue and anorexia and feeling thirsty. In his medical history he had a myocardial infarction 2 years ago. He has had bilateral laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. He was a builder but is now unemployed. He smokes 25 cigarettes per week and drinks around 30 units of alcohol per week. His treatment is twice-daily insulin; he checks his blood glucose irregularly at home.","Examination He is looks dry with reduced skin turgor and poor capillary return. His pulse is regular and 116/min. His blood pressure is 98/72‚ÄâmmHg lying, 74/50‚ÄâmmHg sitting up. He seems short of breath, with a respiratory rate of 30/min. Otherwise, examination of his respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. He has an ulcer on the third toe of his right foot, and the foot looks red and feels warm. He is rousable only to painful stimuli. There is no focal neurology. Funduscopy shows bilateral scars of laser therapy.

He is acidotic. The blood glucose level is not given, but the picture is likely to represent hyperglycaemic ketoacidotic coma. The key clinical features on examination are dehydration shown by skin signs and significant postural hypotension and hyperventilation secondary to a metabolic acidosis, and the triggering problem with the infection in the foot. A persistently high glucose level induced by the response to an infected foot ulcer causes heavy glycosuria, triggering an osmotic diuresis. This leads to hypovolaemia and reduced renal blood flow, causing prerenal uraemia. The extracellular hyperosmolality causes severe cellular dehydration, and loss of water from his brain cells is the cause of his coma. Decreased insulin activity with intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates lipolysis and the production of ketoacids. He has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of ketoac- ids (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate). The anion gap is calculated from the following equation: [Na+] + [K+] ‚àí ([Cl‚àí] + [HCO3 ‚àí]) and is normally 10‚Äì18 mmol/L; in this case it is 31.5‚Äâmmol/L. Ketones cause a characteristi- cally sickly sweet smell on the breath of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (about 20 per cent of the population cannot smell the ketones). The metabolic acidosis stimulates the respira- tory centre, leading to an increase in the rate and depth of respiration (Kussmaul breathing) and producing the reduction in PaCO2 as respiratory compensation for the acidosis. In older diabetic patients there is often evidence of infection (e.g. bronchopneumonia, infected foot ulcer) precipitating these metabolic abnormalities. The differential diagnosis of coma in diabetics includes non-ketotic hyperglycaemic coma, particularly in elderly diabetics; lactic acidosis, especially in patients on metformin; pro- found hypoglycaemia; and non-metabolic causes for coma (e.g. cerebrovascular attacks and drug overdose). Salicylate poisoning may cause hyperglycaemia, hyperventilation and coma, but the metabolic picture is usually one of dominant respiratory alkalosis and mild meta- bolic acidosis. The aims of management are to correct the massive fluid and electrolyte losses, hypergly- caemia and metabolic acidosis. Rapid fluid replacement with intravenous normal saline and potassium supplements should be started. In patients with cardiac or renal disease, a central venous pressure (CVP) line is needed to control fluid balance. Regular monitoring of plasma potassium is essential, as it may fall very rapidly as glucose enters cells. Insulin therapy is given by intravenous infusion adjusted according to blood glucose levels. A nasogastric tube is used to prevent aspiration of gastric contents, and a bladder catheter is needed to measure urine production. Antibiotics and local wound care should be given to treat this man‚Äôs foot ulcer. In the longer term it is important that this patient and his wife are educated about his diabetes, and that he has regular access to diabetes services. His smoking and alcohol consumption will also need to be addressed. There may be social issues to be considered in relation to his unemployment."
"History A 69-year-old widower smoked 20 cigarettes a day for over 40 years but then gave them up 9 months ago when his first grandchild was born. He has had a cough with daily sputum production for the last 20 years and has become short of breath over the last 3 years. He coughs up a little white or yellow sputum every morning. He has put on weight recently and now weighs 100‚Äâkg. His ankles have become swollen recently, and his exercise tolerance has decreased. He can no longer carry his shopping back from the supermarket 180‚Äâm (200 yards) away. He worked as a warehouseman until he was 65 and has become frustrated by his inability to do what he used to do. He is not able to look after his grandchild because he feels too short of breath. There is no other relevant medical or family history. He lives alone and has a cat and a bud- gerigar at home. His general practitioner (GP) gave him a salbutamol metered-dose inhaler, which produced no improvement in his symptoms.","Examination He is overweight. He appears to be centrally and peripherally cyanosed and has some pitting oedema of his ankles. His jugular venous pressure is raised 3‚Äâcm. He has poor chest expan- sion. There are some early inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. Investigations Respiratory function test results are shown: Actual Predicted FEV1 (L) 0.55 2.8‚Äì3.6 FVC (L) 1.35 3.8‚Äì4.6 FER (FEV1/FVC) (%) 41 72‚Äì80 PEF (L/min) 90 310‚Äì440 FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; FER, forced expiratory ratio; PEF, peak expiratory flow His chest X-ray is shown in Figure¬†90.1. Figure 90.1‚ÄÇ Chest X-ray.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the likely diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ What management is appropriate?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 226,"ANSWER 90 The most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical signs and chest X-ray indicate overinflation. The early inspiratory crackles are typical of COPD. Treatment with bronchodilators should be pursued, looking at the effect of b2-agonists and anticholinergic agents, judging the effect from the patient‚Äôs symptoms and exercise tolerance rather than spirometry. Theophylline may sometimes be useful as a third-line therapy but has more side effects. With this degree of severity, inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators (sal- meterol/formoterol or tiotropium) would be appropriate inhaled therapy. Careful attention would need to be given to inhaler technique. He is cyanosed and has signs of right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Blood gases should be checked to see if he might be a candidate for long-term home oxygen therapy (known to improve survival if the pressure of arterial oxygen (pao2) in the steady-state breathing air remains < 7.2 kPa). Gentle diuresis might help the oedema, although oxygen would be a better approach if he is sufficiently hypoxic. Annual influenza vaccination should be recom- mended, and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination should be given. Antibiotics might be kept at home for infective exacerbations. Exercise tolerance will be reduced by his obesity and by lack of muscle use. A weight- reducing diet should be started. If he has the motivation to continue exercising, then a pulmonary rehabilitation programme has been shown to increase exercise tolerance by around 20 per cent and to improve quality of life. Other more dramatic interventions such as lung reduction surgery or transplantation might be considered in a younger patient. Depression is often associated with the poor exercise tolerance and social isolation, and this should be considered. COPD is often regarded as a condition for which treatment has little to offer. However, a vigorous approach tailored to the need of the individual patient can provide a worthwhile benefit."
"History A 50-year-old man has a health screen as part of an application for life insurance. He has no symptoms. He smokes 15 cigarettes per day and drinks 10 units of alcohol per week. In his family history his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 56 years. History A 79-year-old man is brought to his general practitioner by his daughter, who says that he is getting very tired and has lost interest in life. She says that a general malaise has been present for 5‚Äì6 weeks. She thinks that he might have lost a few kilograms in weight over this time, but he does not weigh himself regularly. He says that he has felt limited on exer- tion by tiredness for a year or so, and on a few occasions when he tried to do more, he had a feeling of tightness across his chest. There is no other medical history of note. He smokes 20 cigarettes a day and drinks a pint or two of Guinness each Saturday and Sunday. He is not on any medication and just takes paracetamol occasionally. On systems review, he says that he has lost his appetite over the last month. His sleep has been disturbed by occasional nocturia, and on two or three occasions in the last few weeks, he has been disturbed by sweating at night. There is no relevant family history. He is a retired shopkeeper who normally keeps reasonably fit walking his dog. History A 70-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with acute onset of abdominal pain. The abdominal pain started quite suddenly 24‚Äâh before admission and has continued since then. It is a constant central abdominal pain. She has vomited altered food on one occasion. She has a history of occasional angina on exertion for 5 years. She has a glyceryl trinitrate spray, but she has not needed this in the last 3 months. A year ago she was found to be in atrial fibrillation at 120/min, and she was started on digoxin, which she still takes. The only other medical history of note is that she had a hysterectomy for menorrhagia 30 years ago, and she has hypertension controlled on a small dose of a thiazide diuretic for the last 3 years. She does not take any other medication apart from low-dose aspirin. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. She retired from work as a cleaner 8 years ago.","Examination He weighs 84‚Äâkg and is 1.6‚Äâm (5‚Äâft, 8 in.) tall. His blood pressure is 164/98‚ÄâmmHg. Examination is otherwise normal.

She was tender with some guarding in the cen- tre of the abdomen. No masses were palpable in the abdomen, and there were just occa- sional bowel sounds to hear on auscultation. Over the next 2‚Äâh the blood pressure fell to 84/60‚ÄâmmHg. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and monitored while initial investigations were performed. The abdominal X-ray showed no gas under the diaphragm and no dilated loops of bowel or fluid levels. While under observation, the urine output fell off. Re-examination showed that bowel sounds were absent. Her hands and feet remained warm. Measurements of cardiac output in the ICU showed that it remained high.",Questions  ‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâWhat is the most likely diagnosis?  ‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâWhat investigations are indicated? I aVR V1 V4 V5 V6 V3 aVF III II V2 aVL II Figure 93.1‚ÄÇ Electrocardiogram.  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 234,"ANSWER 92 The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy (R-wave in V5 and S-wave in V1 >35‚Äâmm). Although only a single reading is given, the hypertrophy makes it likely that the blood pres- sure represents sustained hypertension rather than a ‚Äòwhite coat‚Äô effect. Blood pressure readings should be repeated or 24‚Äâh blood pressure monitoring should be performed before treatment is started. The diagnosis of hypertension based upon ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a 24 h average above 130/85; daytime average above 140/90 and nighttime aver- age above 125/75. The risks of vascular disease are related to the presence of other risk factors. The body mass index is 28, showing that he is overweight. He is a smoker with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease. Tables such as the Sheffield table can be used to obtain a calculation of the risks of cardiovascular disease. The other question is whether a search for the cause of the hypertension is indicated. Around 85 per cent of cases are idiopathic. Most of the secondary cases are related to renal disease, and the renal function is normal here. A number of endocrine causes (Cushing‚Äôs syndrome, Conn‚Äôs syndrome) are associated with hypokalaemia. If the blood pressure is difficult to con- trol, secondary causes such as renal artery stenosis should be considered and investigated by renal ultrasound or a technique to visualize the renal arteries, such as magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause resis- tant hypertension. The cholesterol is at a level that would warrant treatment if there was evidence of vascular disease. The hypertension itself should be controlled according to current guidelines, which would recommend starting with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in a patient younger than 55 years. Key Points ‚Ä¢ A single elevated blood pressure needs to be remeasured over several weeks. ‚Ä¢ All relevant risk factors should be considered in assessing cardiovascular risk and planning treatment. ‚Ä¢ Most cases of hypertension do not have an identifiable underlying cause.  Case 93:‚ÄÇ Tiredness 233 Case 93:‚ÄÇ Tiredness ANSWER 93 This 79-year-old man has the clinical features of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. The mur- murs are of mixed aortic valve disease and the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy (sum of negative deflection in V1 and positive deflection in V5 or V2 and V6 greater than 35‚Äâmm), suggesting that there has been significant pressure overload from aortic stenosis. The find- ings of mixed aortic valve disease, microscopic haematuria, malaise and fever (probable with the history of night sweats) make it likely that the diagnosis is infective endocarditis. This would also fit with the haematological picture showing normocytic anaemia, raised neutro- phil count and a high ESR. In the elderly, infective endocarditis may be an insidious illness and should be considered in any patient who has murmurs and fever or any other change in the cardiac signs or symptoms. The other classical findings of splenomegaly, splinter haemorrhages, clubbing, Osler‚Äôs nodes, Janeway lesions and Roth‚Äôs spots are usually absent. Precipitating events such as dental treatment or other sources of bacteraemia may not be evident in the history. It is difficult to tie all the features into any other single diagnosis. The signs are of aortic valve disease. When there is a fever or other evidence of infection in the presence of valve disease, infective endocarditis must always be considered, although in practice other unrelated infec- tions are more common. Other infections, such as tuberculosis or abscess, are possible, or there could be an underlying lymphoma or other malignancy. The most important investigations would be the following: ‚Ä¢ blood cultures performed before any antibiotics are given. In this case three blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans. ‚Ä¢ echocardiogram, which showed a thickened bicuspid aortic valve, a common con- genital abnormality predisposing to significant functional valve disturbance in middle and old age. Vegetations can be detected on a transthoracic echocardio- gram if they are prominent; at transoesophageal echocardiogram is more sensi- tive in detecting vegetations on the valves but more demanding for the patient and the operator. Treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for 2 weeks, followed by oral amoxicillin resulted in resolution of the fever with no haemodynamic deterioration or change in the murmurs of mixed aortic valve disease. A microbiologist should be consulted about appropriate antibiotics and duration. After treatment of the endocarditis, the symptoms of pain and tiredness on exertion would need to be considered to see if valve surgery was indicated. Prior to this it would be routine to look at the coronary arteries by angiography to see if simultaneous coronary artery surgery was needed in a patient of this age. Key Points ‚Ä¢ Symptoms on exertion in aortic valve disease are a sign that valve surgery needs to be considered. ‚Ä¢ In infective endocarditis, it is unusual to have many of the classical physical signs. In the elderly, it may present with non-specific malaise.  Case 94:‚ÄÇ Abdominal Pain 235 Case 94:‚ÄÇ Abdominal Pain"
"History A 66-year-old woman notices that she is having trouble performing some everyday tasks, such as doing up buttons on her blouse and chopping vegetables for cooking. She complains that her muscles feel stiff, and it is taking her longer than it did to walk to the local shops. She is anxious about these problems since she lives alone and has to do everything for herself. She has noticed a little shakiness, which she ascribes to anxiety. Her daughter has told her that it is becoming increasingly difficult to read the small writing in the letters she sends. She is a retired journalist and has no significant past medical history. There is no distur- bance of her bowels or micturition. Her appetite has been good and her weight steady. She complains that she has been sleeping poorly and is consequently rather tired. She does not smoke tobacco and drinks only occasionally. She has hypertension and takes 50‚Äâmg atenolol daily.","Examination Her pulse is 60/min and regular; blood pressure is 134/84‚ÄâmmHg. There are no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. On neurological examination there is no muscle wasting. She has generally increased muscle tone throughout the range of movement, equal in flexors and extensors. There is a slight tremor affecting mainly her right hand, which is suppressed when she tries to do something. She has problems with fine tasks such as doing up buttons. Power, reflexes, coordination and sensation are all normal. When asked to walk she is a little slow to get started and has difficulty stopping and turning.",Questions ‚Ä¢ What is the diagnosis? ‚Ä¢ How would you investigate and manage this patient?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 238,"ANSWER 95 There is evidence in the history and examination of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Her writing shows micrographia secondary to the rigidity and slowness of movement. Her hypertension is well controlled on the beta-blocker. Beta-blockers can cause tiredness and slowness but not to the extent seen in this woman. This woman has Parkinson‚Äôs disease presenting with the classic triad of tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia. Tremor is usually an early symptom and may be unilateral. The combination of tremor with rigidity leads to the cogwheel form of rigidity. The patient often goes on to have a blank mask-like facies. There is difficulty starting to walk (freezing), and the patient uses small steps and has difficulty stopping (festination). There is generally normal intellectual function, but there is often depression. Sleep is often disturbed, contributing to daytime tiredness. The characteristic pathological abnormality is degeneration of dopamine-secreting neurones in the nigrostria- tal pathway of the basal ganglia. Parkinsonian features (parkinsonism) may occur in a variety of diseases: ‚Ä¢ Parkinson‚Äôs disease ‚Ä¢ postencephalitic parkinsonism ‚Ä¢ neuroleptic drug-induced Parkinson‚Äôs disease ‚Ä¢ parkinsonism in association with Alzheimer‚Äôs/multi-infarct dementia. ! Classification of tremor ‚Ä¢ Rest tremor: the tremor is worse at rest and is typical of parkinsonism. ‚Ä¢ Postural tremor: this is characteristic of benign essential tremor, physiological tremor and exaggerated physiological tremor caused by anxiety, alcohol and thy- rotoxicosis. Benign essential tremor is not present at rest, but appears on holding the arms outstretched, but is not worse on movement (finger‚Äìnose testing). Tests of coordination are normal, and walking is unaffected. There is usually a family his- tory of tremor, and the tremor is helped by alcohol and beta-blockers. ‚Ä¢ Intention tremor: the tremor is worse on movement and is most obvious in finger‚Äì nose testing. It is usually caused by brainstem or cerebellar disease caused by such diseases as multiple sclerosis, localized tumours or spinocerebellar degeneration. A variety of drugs are available to treat this woman‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Selegiline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, may delay the need to start levodopa and may slow the rate of progression of the disease but has significant side effects. Levodopa is usually used in combination with a selective dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, which does not cross the blood‚Äì brain barrier and reduces peripheral adverse effects. The commonest side effects are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, postural hypotension and neuropsychiatric problems. After many years of treatment the effects tend to diminish, and the patient may develop rapid oscillations in control‚Äîthe ‚Äòon‚Äìoff‚Äô effect. When these develop, a sustained-release formulation of levodopa or a dopamine agonist (e.g. bromocriptine) may produce improvement. Because of the loss of effect with time, treatment should not be started too early. This requires careful discussion with the individual patient. She should be assessed by a physiotherapist and occupational therapist and provided with advice and aids. With time her house may need to be altered to aid her mobility.  Case 95:‚ÄÇ Clumsiness 239"
"History Four months ago a 47-year-old publican was admitted to hospital with acute chest pain. A subendocardial inferior myocardial infarction was diagnosed, and he was treated with thrombolytics and aspirin. After discharge he complained of angina, and a coronary angi- ography was performed. This showed severe triple-vessel disease not suitable for stenting, and coronary artery bypass grafting was performed. He is attending a cardiac rehabilitation clinic, and he has had no further angina since his surgery. He has a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease, with his father and two paternal uncles having died of myocardial infarctions in their 50s; his 50-year-old brother has angina. He is married with two children. He smokes 25 cigarettes per day and drinks at least 40 units of alcohol per week.

He has many clinical features to go with the high cholesterol and premature vascular disease. This man has familial hypercholesterolaemia. He has presented with premature coronary artery disease. His absent pedal pulses suggest peripheral vascular disease. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant condition. The homo- zygous condition is rare, and affected individuals usually die before the age of 20 years due to premature atherosclerosis. The heterozygous form affects about 1 in 400 individu- als in the United Kingdom, and 50 per cent of males will develop ischaemic heart disease before the age of 50 years. Corneal arcus, xanthelasmata and xanthomata on Achilles ten- dons and the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hands develop in early adult life. The metabolic defect is a result of a reduced number of high-affinity cell-surface LDL receptors. This leads to increased LDL levels. Increased uptake of LDL by macrophage scavenger recep- tors leads to increased oxidized LDL, which is particularly atherogenic. Triglyceride and VLDL levels are normal or mildly elevated. HDL levels are low. The other major causes of hypercholesterolaemia are familial combined hyperlipidaemia and polygenic hypercholes- terolaemia. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia differs from familial hypercholesterolaemia in patients having raised triglycerides. Patients with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia have a similar lipid profile to familial hypercholesterolaemia but they do not develop xantho- mata. Hypercholesterolaemia may commonly occur in hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome and hepatic cholestasis. This patient is at extremely high risk for further vascular events, especially occlusion of his coronary artery bypass grafts. His risk depends on the combination of his risk factors, and all of these need attention. He should be advised to stop smoking, reduce his alcohol intake (which is also affecting his liver, as judged from the raised gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), take more exercise, and eat a strict low-cholesterol diet. Diet alone will not control this level of cholesterol. He should have pharmacological treatment with a statin but may need com- bined treatment for this level of hyperlipidaemia. His children should have their lipid profile measured so that they can be treated to prevent premature coronary artery disease. There is clear evidence from clinical trials that primary prevention of coronary artery disease can be achieved by lowering serum cholesterol. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) showed cholesterol lowering with pravastatin reduced both the number of coro- nary events and coronary mortality in middle-aged men with a serum LDL level greater than 4‚Äâmmol/L. In patients who have evidence of cardiovascular disease, secondary prevention is even more important, aiming for a cholesterol level as low as possible. Statins are well toler- ated, although myositis is a rare but serious complication."
"History A 66-year-old man has been persuaded by his wife to go to his general practitioner (GP). She is worried that he has changed. Over the last 4 weeks he has become lethargic and rather vague. He has a 12-year history of chronic cough and sputum production, but she thinks that these symptoms may have increased a little over the last 8 weeks. He has smoked 20 cigarettes daily for the last 50 years, and he drinks around 14 units of alcohol per week. Two years ago he became depressed and was treated with an antidepressant for 6 months with good effect. She cannot remember the name of the medication. He had worked all his life as a postman until retirement 6 years ago.","Examination He is a little vague in his answers to questions. There are no abnormalities in the cardio- vascular, respiratory or abdominal systems. There is no lymphadenopathy. On neurological examination he seems to have mild generalized muscle weakness. Reflexes, tone and sensa- tion are all normal. His peak flow and spirometry measures are within normal limits.

Figure 98.1‚ÄÇ Chest X-ray.",Questions ‚Ä¢ How do you interpret these findings? ‚Ä¢ What would be the appropriate management?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 248,"ANSWER 98 The blood results show hyponatraemia, and the chest X-ray shows a mass overlying the right hilum. This degree of hyponatraemia might be expected to cause some cerebral changes. A lower level might be associated with seizures. Above 120‚Äì125‚Äâmmol/L, the effects are likely to be non-specific tiredness. Possible causes for the hyponatraemia in this man are ‚Ä¢ inappropriate arginine vasopressin (AVP, antidiuretic hormone) secretion in asso- ciation with the respiratory disorders of undifferentiated small-cell carcinoma of the lung or, occasionally, with pneumonia or tuberculosis; or ‚Ä¢ Addison‚Äôs disease (adrenocortical failure), which would be expected to produce a high potassium level and postural hypotension. Addison‚Äôs disease might be linked with respiratory problems through adrenal involvement by metastases or tuberculosis. Other causes, such as diuretic treatment; inappropriate AVP from drug therapy (e.g. carbam- azepine, phenothiazines, amitriptyline); cerebrovascular events; salt-losing nephropathies; or overhydration from intravenous fluids or overdrinking are not likely from the story given here. He has been treated with antidepressants, but not for the last 18 months. In view of the chest X-ray, the most likely diagnosis is inappropriate AVP secretion with a small-cell undifferenti- ated carcinoma of the lung. This can be confirmed by measurement of serum and urine osmo- larities to show serum dilution while the urine is concentrated. Levels of AVP can be measured. In this case, the osmolarities confirmed the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH); bronchial biopsies at fibre-optic bronchoscopy showed a small-cell undif- ferentiated carcinoma. Extension to the carina and computed tomography (CT) appearances showed it was not resectable. Fluid restriction to 750‚ÄâmL daily produced an increase in serum sodium to128‚Äâmmol/L with improvement in the confusion and weakness. If this fails to pro- duce adequate results, demeclocycline can be used. This derivative of tetracycline antibiot- ics interferes with the action of ADH in the renal tubules. Vasopressin antagonists such as tolvaptan are also effective at raising serum sodium, but they are expensive and can cause over-rapid correction. Chemotherapy was started for the lung tumour. Such treatment often produces a response in terms of shrinkage of the tumour, improved quality of life and increased survival. It may also help the ectopic hormone secretion. Unfortunately, cure is still infrequent. Small-cell undiffer- entiated carcinomas of the lung are fast-growing tumours, usually unresectable at presentation."
"History A 20-year-old woman has complained of intermittent shortness of breath with wheezing and cough for 3 years. She had eczema and rhinitis up to 8 years of age. A diagnosis of asthma was made but control of her symptoms has been difficult and she is now being treated with salbutamol, salmeterol, high dose inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast. The breathless- ness is intermittent. When the breathlessness comes on she feels unable to take air into her lungs, and is often unable to speak and finds that multiple doses of salbutamol provide little relief. She presents to the accident and emergency department with an acute exacerbation of her breathlessness.","Examination She is unable to speak in more than a whisper. Her respiratory rate is 26/min. Pulse rate is 92/min and blood pressure 128/84‚ÄâmmHg. Her temperature is 36.8¬∞C and oxygen saturation is 98% on air. The heart sounds are normal. There is a generalized inspiratory and expiratory wheeze heard all over the chest but no other abnormalities. She finds it difficult to perform a peak flow recording but manages 60‚ÄâL/min. Investigations After recovery from this acute episode she is sent for respiratory function tests which show: Actual Postbronchodilator Predicted FEV1 (L) 3.5 3.7 3.5‚Äì4.3 FVC (L) 4.6 4.8 4.6‚Äì5.4 FER (FEV1/FVC) (%) 76 77 72‚Äì80 PEF (L/min) 440 480 440‚Äì540 FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1‚Äâs; FVC, forced vital capacity; FER, forced expiratory ratio; PEF, peak expiratory flow. Question ‚Ä¢ What is the most likely diagnosis?  100 Cases in Clinical Medicine 250",,"ANSWER 99 This woman has intermittent breathlessness with wheezing. Much the commonest cause of these symptoms would be asthma but there are a number of features which make this less likely in this patient. Loss of voice is a prominent symptom. The history suggests little response to beta agonist treatment, and the lung function tests after recovery from the episode do not show airflow obstruction or a significant response to bronchodilators. The airway narrowing in asthma may be intermittent showing no obstruction between attacks, in which case it may be nec- essary to look for increased bronchial responsiveness to a challenge such as exercise or inhaled methacholine. During the acute episode in association with severe symptoms the oxygen saturation is, surprisingly, normal. Inability to speak in complete sentences is a characteristic of severe asthma but the loss of voice here suggests that there may be a problem at vocal cord level and this would fit with the marked inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and the feeling of being unable to take air into her lungs although asthmatics may complain of similar problems. These features suggest that the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction is more likely than asthma in this woman. In this condition there is paradoxical motion of the vocal cords so that they adduct on inspiration to produce inspiratory airflow obstruction at the level of the larynx. Episodes of breathlessness tend to be intermittent, unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment and associated with stridor. The most important diagnostic tests are direct viewing of the cords by an ear nose and throat surgeon and a flow volume loop. Inspection of the cords will show paradoxical motion and adduction of the anterior cords with a posterior ‚Äòglottis chink‚Äô allowing limited airflow. A flow volume loop will show a relatively normal expiratory phase but loss of flow or low flow in the latter part of the inspiratory loop as the vocal cords adduct and produce obstruction (Figure 99.1). In asthma, obstruction would be evident in both expiratory and inspiratory limbs of the flow volume loop. Expiratory Ô¨Çow Inspiratory Ô¨Çow Volume  Figure 99.1‚ÄÇ Flow‚Äìvolume loop showing cutoff of inspiratory flow in vocal cord dysfunction.  Case 99:‚ÄÇ Shortness of Breath 251 It is important to recognise this condition so that inappropriate treatment for asthma can be stopped and appropriate treatment can be started. Vocal cord dysfunction is present in around 10% of patients with refractory asthma. It is more common in the presence of psychi- atric problems such as depression and anxiety and may be associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux which should be treated. The mainstays of treatment are speech therapy, relaxation and breathing techniques."
History A 48-year-old woman is seen by her GP complaining of tiredness for several months. She also has suffered from headaches over the past 6 weeks for which she has been taking regular ibu- profen. She has no significant past medical history. She has two children aged 16 and 13. Her pregnancies were uncomplicated. She has complained of painful periods over many years for which she has taken a variety of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs and over-the-counter herbal remedies.,"Examination She looks pale. Her pulse is 84/min regular, blood pressure 178/102‚ÄâmmHg, jugular venous pressure not raised, heart sounds normal. Her respiratory and abdominal examinations are normal. Neurological examination is normal. Funduscopy shows arteriovenous nipping and silver-wiring of the retinal vessels.

Her urinalysis is negative, which excludes a glomerular disease. It is more likely that her renal failure is due to either tubulointerstitial disease or disease affecting the renal vasculature such as acceler- ated phase hypertension. Potential causes of tubulointerstitial disease in this case are the NSAIDs and the herbal medicines. Her hypertension is likely secondary to her tubulointer- stitial disease, and is accelerating the progression of her renal failure. NSAIDs cause acute kidney injury by two different mechanisms: haemodyamically medi- ated and acute interstitial nephritis. Haemodynamically mediated acute renal failure is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins cause prerenal vasodilatation which is crucial to maintain renal perfusion in the setting of hypovolaemia, cirrhosis and heart failure. In this case there is no evidence that she Is dehydrated. NSAIDs also cause an acute interstitial nephritis. There may be an associated fever, rash, eosinophilia and eosinophi- luria. Spontaneous recovery occurs within a few months after the NSAID is discontinued although there may be permanent renal damage. A course of prednisolone is generally given to accelerate renal recovery and lessen long-term scarring. NSAIDs can also induce minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy causing nephritic syndrome. In addition to these acute effects, it has been suggested that daily NSAID use for a prolonged period of time may be associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, although the percentage of patients is small relative to the number of NSAIDs that are bought over the counter. Traditional Chinese medicine includes herbal therapy, acupuncture, massage and dietary therapy. There is potential for developing novel treatments for diseases such as asthma and food allergies with Chinese herbs. However, there is concern over the lack of standardization and controlled clinical trials. Chinese herbal medicines containing aristolochic acid have been implicated in a specific nephropathy characterised by extensive interstitial fibrosis with atrophy and loss of the tubules, with thickening of the walls of the interlobular and afferent arterioles. Blood pressure is generally normal or only modestly elevated. Patients presenting with a creatinine < 200 will generally stabilise their renal function after stopping the Chinese medications, but patients with worse kidney function will generally progress to end-stage kidney failure. In this case it is important to find out if her renal failure is acute or long-standing. This can easily be discovered if she has had previous measurements of her serum creatinine. Renal ultrasound is also helpful. If the ultrasound shows small echogenic kidneys her renal failure is likely chronic. If her kidneys are normal in size, a renal biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of inflammation and scarring. In this case her renal failure is likely due to a NSAID-induced interstitial nephritis. She should be advised to stop her NSAIDs and Chinese herbal medicines, and never to restart these drugs. She should be given a short course of prednisolone to hasten renal recovery."
